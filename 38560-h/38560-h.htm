<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo;</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;What dandy luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too good to be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ever thought we&rsquo;d have the luck to
get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true. I shan&rsquo;t believe it till it
gets here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it <i>is</i> true, and won&rsquo;t we have the
niftiest time ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you might as well sit down, Bob.
Running around like a hen with her head cut
off won&rsquo;t make it come any sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, how&rsquo;s a fellow to sit still when a thing
like that&rsquo;s on the way? I wonder how long we&rsquo;ll
have to wait. What can be keeping him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A score of voices, talking singly, two together,
all together, woke the woodland echoes,
silent through the long winter and tardy spring,
gone at last. Summer had come and with it the
annual encampment of a score or more of manly,
healthy youngsters, overflowing with animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
spirits and vitality. For several years past, substantially
the same group under the supervision
of a Mr. Hollis, a gentleman of sterling character
and considerable means, had gone into
camp together for two or three weeks of the
heated season. Brimming over with life, the
boys always made the camp a lively place; but
this summer a new and enveloping excitement
seemed to have taken possession of everyone,
and now all were plunged into a discussion of
the cause of the hullabaloo, the voices rising
higher and higher as each one sought to make
himself heard above the rest.</p>

<p>Turning a bend in the road that brought the
camp into view, Mr. Hollis, as he witnessed the
excited gestures of the boys, and heard the volume
of sound caused by every enthusiast trying
to talk at once, instinctively quickened his pace,
for it almost seemed as though a serious altercation
were in progress; but as he came near
enough to distinguish words and heard&mdash;&ldquo;Six
cylinders,&rdquo; &ldquo;Forty-eight horsepower,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chrome
nickel steel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wheel base one hundred and
twelve inches,&rdquo; &ldquo;Diamond tires,&rdquo; &ldquo;Autometer,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Safety treads,&rdquo; &ldquo;Grip treads&rdquo;&mdash;he realized
that nothing more serious was going on than a
discussion of the relative merits of automobiles
and their fittings. No wonder there was gesturing
and loud talking. What boy would not rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to the topmost heights of enthusiasm at the
thought of an automobile in which he was to
have a personal interest? Such a delight had
come to the camp, and since the announcement
in the morning that on account of the long trips
that the summer&rsquo;s plans would make necessary,
the boys would be allowed an automobile for
their own exclusive use, nothing else had been
thought or talked about; and each eager boy
was impatiently awaiting the return of Mr.
Hollis to learn the make and all other details
of that most wonderful car.</p>

<p>Now, as he came into camp, the boys crowded
around him and the wood rang with cheers as
he told them that the car would arrive the following
morning. A volley of questions overwhelmed
him: &ldquo;How large is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;What
speed?&rdquo; &ldquo;What color is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;How many
of us can ride in it at a time?&rdquo; Question followed
question in quick succession, until Mr.
Hollis put his hands over his ears, and, refusing
to answer any more, proposed dinner as a means
of quelling the noise.</p>

<p>The boys could scarcely have told of what
their dinner consisted that night, so great was
their excitement. All were glad to turn in early
as the surest way to bring the morning and the
longed-for car. A full hour earlier than usual
the lights were out and silence settled over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
camp, broken only by nature&rsquo;s mysterious night
sounds. A belated rabbit homeward bound,
keeping ceaseless vigil with round bright eyes,
encouraged by the unusual quiet, crept close to
the door of the mess tent, and snatching a stray
cracker from the grass, scurried joyfully away.
At the distant menacing &ldquo;Tu-whit, tu-whoo&rdquo; of
the night owl, the birds stirred uneasily and nestled
closer under cover of the sheltering leaves.
The quiet hours crept on till at last morning
dawned and gave promise of a glorious
day.</p>

<p>Frank Edgewood was the first to open sleepy
eyes, and seeing a few clouds not yet dissipated
by the early sun, woke the camp with the dismal
wail: &ldquo;Fellows, it&rsquo;s going to rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put him out,&rdquo; &ldquo;Smother him,&rdquo; &ldquo;Duck him
in the brook,&rdquo; came in a chorus; and Frank, taking
to his heels, dropped the flap of his tent,
with not a moment to spare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run early and avoid the rush,&rdquo; sang out
Tom Henderson.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To pass he had such scanty room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The descending grazed his plume,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">chanted Dick Trent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forgive and forget,&rdquo; said Ben Cooper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be glad we let you live, Frank,&rdquo; Bob Ward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
chimed in; and so the culprit, reassured, ventured
out to breakfast.</p>

<p>Again the all-absorbing topic was renewed,
two vital questions claiming them. What should
they name their auto? Who would be able to
run it? The first was easy enough, for almost
from the first they had decided, the color permitting,
to call it the &ldquo;Red Scout.&rdquo; The second
was not so easy, for Mr. Hollis must be assured,
for the sake of the general safety, that the driver
should be fully capable. If only Bert Wilson
were there, the question would be answered, for
capable Bert in New York had studied the mechanism
of automobiles and grown very proficient
in handling them; but they were not sure that
he would be able to be in camp with them this
year. Expressions of regret were heard on all
sides, for Bert had a very warm place in their
hearts. His splendid qualities had easily made
him their natural leader and his absence was far
more keenly felt than that of any other fellow
in the camp would have been.</p>

<p>Still, Bert not being there, they must choose
someone else, so Mr. Hollis called for volunteers.
Several answered, but their qualifications
were rather doubtful, until Bob Ward said that
he had had a lot of experience in driving his
uncle&rsquo;s machine, and felt very sure he could handle
it. So it was decided that the next day Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
should take them on their first trip, which would
be in search of a new camp site, the old one
proving too small for this year&rsquo;s requirements.</p>

<p>While the question as to who should be chosen
to drive the automobile was being decided, Sam
Fielding and Philip Strong, two of the younger
boys, had placed a long plank over a big rock
which rested under the shade of a low-branched
tree, and thus improvised a capital see-saw.
When the question was settled, there was a general
movement among the boys, and one of them,
thoughtless of consequences, jumped upon Sam&rsquo;s
end of the board. This added weight gave the
other end a sudden jerk upward, and in a twinkling
Philip was tossed into the boughs of the
tree, where, his foot catching in a forked branch,
he hung suspended, head downward, his jacket
falling about and covering his head and face,
while he yelled like a Comanche Indian.</p>

<p>In an instant the entire camp was aroused and
Phil was quickly extricated from his uncomfortable
position. At the sight of his astonished
face, the whole camp went into paroxysms of
mirth, while peal after peal of laughter made the
woods echo again. Even Phil, now &ldquo;right side
up with care,&rdquo; could not resist the contagion and
joined in the merriment.</p>

<p>It was many minutes before a normal condition
of things was re-established, but at last the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
boys fell to discussing the proposed change of
camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame that we have to change,&rdquo; said
Charlie Adams; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ll have such
bully times in the new camp as we have had
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tom cheerily;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have the dandiest fun, hunting new caves
and things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will at least have the charm of novelty,&rdquo;
joined in Dick Trent&mdash;Dick was eighteen and
sometimes used words and phrases so ponderous
as to give him added dignity in the eyes of the
other fellows. &ldquo;Things will be altogether different
this summer,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;having the
auto will make a great change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re going to have a great time to-day,
anyway,&rdquo; said Bob Ward; &ldquo;Mr. Hollis
says we are to make a flying trip in the new
machine, and I will have a chance, while the man
who brings it is here, to study handling the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Bob finished speaking, a distant but distinct
&ldquo;honk-honk&rdquo; sent each boy tearing down the
road, where in due time a great, red, glistening
car came up the turnpike like a gleaming streak
of light, and, with a graceful curve to the side
of the road, stopped. The car, <i>their</i> car, the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; had come!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Flying Auto</span></h3>


<p class="cap">A group of the campers stood regarding
the big red touring car rather dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; Bob Ward was saying, as he
meditatively chewed a long piece of grass, &ldquo;you
never can tell when the fool thing is going to go
back on you. I used to drive my uncle&rsquo;s car a
good deal, but I never could go very far without
some part of the machinery breaking down.
Uncle Jack said I was a Jonah and I guess I
was, because he could run the pesky thing all
over the country if I wasn&rsquo;t with him, and it
would go like a bird. One day I ran it into a
fence and nearly got killed, so I took the hint
and haven&rsquo;t fooled with one since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we ought to make a try at locating a
site for the new camp,&rdquo; Frank Edgewood objected.
&ldquo;We volunteered, and we&rsquo;ll be the
laughing stock of the whole camp if we don&rsquo;t
succeed, besides breaking our word to Mr.
Hollis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t see why you said you could do
it, if you are going to get cold feet at the last
minute,&rdquo; said Jim.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got cold feet,&rdquo; Bob defended hotly,
then virtuously, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t because of my own danger
that I hesitate, but I don&rsquo;t like to drag you
fellows into it with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind breaking your own neck,
you needn&rsquo;t worry about ours,&rdquo; said Dave Ferris;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll stay here while you take a little spin
across country,&rdquo; grinning wickedly. &ldquo;Of course,
if you should find a good camp location in the
meantime, you could claim all the glory&rdquo;&mdash;this
last condescendingly.</p>

<p>Before Bob had time to retort, a cry of &ldquo;Bert,
Bert Wilson!&rdquo; caught the boys&rsquo; attention, and
they turned in time to see a young fellow take
a flying leap over one of the fences and land in
the midst of a group of excited, welcoming
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make believe we&rsquo;re not glad to see you,
Bert. We thought you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get
off this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Henderson spread that report. Where
is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till I get at him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ought to have a ducking,&rdquo; and other undeserved
threats were hurled at poor Tom&rsquo;s
innocent head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, fellows,&rdquo; said Bert, laughing;
&ldquo;Tom wasn&rsquo;t to blame. I didn&rsquo;t know myself
that I could make the camp till yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment the maligned Tom dashed up,
nearly upsetting his friend in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick with a capital B and the best
kind of a sight for sore eyes,&rdquo; gasped Tom, getting
his breath back by degrees. &ldquo;I never was
so glad to see anyone in my life. And you came
just in the nick of time, too, to help us out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, dragging his friend away unceremoniously,
Tom explained the situation in which he
and the other volunteers found themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will help us out, won&rsquo;t you, Bert?&rdquo; he
asked appealingly.</p>

<p>By this time the rest of the volunteers had
come up and were eagerly awaiting the decision.
When they heard Bert&rsquo;s hearty &ldquo;Surest thing you
know,&rdquo; they went wild, and after giving him
&ldquo;three cheers and a tiger,&rdquo; marched him off to
the mess tent, there to partake of corn bread and
maple syrup. This last had such a good effect
on Bert as to lead him to say that the fellow who
had never known the gastronomic delight of corn
bread spread thick with maple syrup didn&rsquo;t know
what it was to live.</p>

<p>The dramatic arrival of Bert at the camp just
when they most felt the need of him had been
almost as unexpected to him as to the other
campers.</p>

<p>Through the recommendation of Mr. Hollis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
he had secured a position with a large manufacturing
business in New York. There from the
very start he had made good and his industry and
ability were soon noted by his employer. It was
not long before his salary was increased and
larger opportunities afforded him, and he soon
found himself treading the path that was bound
to lead to success.</p>

<p>Of course, like every other healthy boy, he felt
the need of friends and recreation. The first he
found in Tom Henderson, with whom he struck
up a great friendship. Another crony was Frank
Edgewood, who worked on the same floor as himself.
When the work of the day was done they
were usually found together, either in each other&rsquo;s
rooms or at some of the places of wholesome
recreation of which the city offers so great a
variety.</p>

<p>If Bert had one trait that stood out more prominently
than any of the others it was his love for
mechanics. Anything in the way of a clever mechanical
toy, a puzzle, or a machine attracted him
immensely. He wanted to &ldquo;see the wheels go
&rsquo;round.&rdquo; Especially was this true in the case
of automobiles. The huge machine moving so
swiftly, so noiselessly, with such a sense of freedom
and the sensation of flying, drew him like a
magnet. He scarcely dared to dream that one
day he might be the actual owner of a motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
car, but he did hope that some day or other his
hand might be on the wheel, his foot upon the
brake, while he steered the flying monster as it
sped like a flash across the country.</p>

<p>His dream seemed perceptibly nearer being
realized when Tom introduced him to the owner
of a garage in the vicinity of his home. There
he speedily became familiar with every joint and
crank and lever of the great machines. He saw
them taken apart and put together, he saw them
brought in battered, broken, almost wrecked, and
made as good as new. From theory to practice
was not far. Little by little he was permitted to
help in the minor repairs. After a while he was
entrusted with short trips, at first in the company
of an experienced chauffeur and at last on his own
responsibility. It was not long before he felt
capable to handle, steer, drive, and repair, and,
if he had cared to do so, he would have had no
difficulty in passing an examination and securing
a license to drive a car.</p>

<p>His idea of recreation ran in the same direction.
Whenever there was a motor meet anywhere
within reach, especially on Saturday afternoon,
which was a half holiday at the factory,
Bert could be found, accompanied by either Tom
or Frank, or both, watching with intense delight
the exciting incidents of the race. The crowd&mdash;the
start&mdash;the great machines flying by like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
streaks of lightning&mdash;the roar of the partisans
of each car as their favorite took the lead, and
above all the frantic excitement and enthusiasm
at the finish as the victor flew across the line&mdash;all
these things stirred his blood with inexpressible
delight.</p>

<p>On another occasion he and his chums had visited
the &ldquo;Greatest Show on Earth.&rdquo; He had
laughed at the clowns and had been thrilled by
the acrobats. Every pore of his body had drunk
in with delight the tremendous feats of skill and
daring that appeal so strongly to a boy. But the
one supreme thrill, the one he never forgot, the
one that repeated itself over and over again in
his dreams, was when the automobile with its
daring operator starting from the very top of
the immense building, amid the deathlike hush of
the crowd, flew like a flash down the steep incline,
sprang into space, turned a complete somersault,
and, lighting on the further side of the gap,
rushed across the arena. This was the climax of
everything. Little else appealed to Bert; he
talked of nothing else on the way home. There
was no use talking, the &ldquo;auto fever&rdquo; was in his
blood.</p>

<p>With this passionate delight in his favorite machine,
Bert&rsquo;s feeling can be understood when he
learned that the chief feature of the boys&rsquo; encampment
when the summer opened was to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
automobile &ldquo;hike,&rdquo; the car itself having been
kindly loaned by Mr. Hollis. At first, owing to
conditions at the factory, he had feared that he
would not be able to go at the time set for the
encampment, and his disappointment was crushing.
A quiet little talk of Mr. Hollis&rsquo;s with his
employer, however, had adjusted things so that
he learned at the last moment he would be able
to go. We have already seen how uproariously
he had been received by his old companions when
he came so unexpectedly into the howling mob
of enthusiasts at the summer camp.</p>

<p>In less time after his arrival than it takes to
tell, Bert was clad in khaki and had obtained the
ready permission of Mr. Hollis to take the boys
on their desired expedition.</p>

<p>The fellows scrambled into their adored &ldquo;Red
Scout&rdquo; with more haste than grace, while Bert was
busy cranking it. Then with a cry of &ldquo;All right
back there?&rdquo; and an answering shout of &ldquo;You
bet your life,&rdquo; the great car started smoothly up
the ascent.</p>

<p>As it quickened its speed and disappeared
around a bend of the road, more than one of
the boys at the camp wished he had been quicker
to offer his services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only known that Bert would be here
I&rsquo;d been one of the first to volunteer, but I must
say I wasn&rsquo;t anxious to trust my neck to Bob&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
safe-keeping. He doesn&rsquo;t know any more about
running an automobile than I do;&rdquo; and when Jim
said that he was saying a great deal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the &ldquo;Red Scout&rsquo;s&rdquo; passengers were
having the time of their lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;s like flying,&rdquo; said Frank joyfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a heap sight better,&rdquo; challenged Tom.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make it go faster?&rdquo; he asked of
Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess yes,&rdquo; Bert shouted, as he put on more
speed.</p>

<p>The automobile darted forward like a live
thing and the boys were enraptured by the rapidity
of its motion. It almost seemed to them
as though the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; were standing still and
all the scenery were flying past. Hardly did the
farmhouses come in sight than they were passed
and lost in the distance.</p>

<p>Scores of timid little woodland creatures scurried
away to the shelter of holes and empty logs,
surprised and alarmed at the streak of red lightning
that flashed by. Mother birds hovered protectingly
over their fledglings, ready to defend
them against the whole world if necessary, while
excited squirrels scolded noisily from the treetops
long after they had any excuse for it.</p>

<p>On, on they rushed along roads over which
giant trees met, past meadow lands where cattle
grazed lazily, over bridges, past sparkling brooks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that formed miniature waterfalls as they rushed
over the stones&mdash;on, on!</p>

<p>As they slowed up to take a sharp bend in the
road they came face to face with another automobile
dashing along at a reckless speed.</p>

<p>Fortunately both Bert and the driver of the
other machine kept their presence of mind. Before
anyone had a chance to realize what was
happening, Bert had swerved the Scout way over
to the right side of the road. There happened
to be a fairly deep depression on that side, so
Bert had the choice of two evils. He had either
to crash squarely into the other automobile or
he had to run the risk of having his own machine
turn turtle. He chose the lesser danger and ran
into the ditch. However, it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it
easily might have been, for only the front and
rear wheels of one side of the car were in the
depression. Even at that they had come within
a hair&rsquo;s-breadth of being upset.</p>

<p>As soon as the boys could pull themselves together,
they tumbled out of the car. The occupants
of the other car were four men, who sprang
out at once to see if they could be of service in
any way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better improvise a lever,&rdquo; Bert
suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may look all right in print,&rdquo; grumbled
Bob, &ldquo;but how are you going to do it?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know how we can work it all right,&rdquo; said
one of the men. &ldquo;See those big stones over
there? Well, the first thing to do is to bring
them over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see what you mean to do,&rdquo; Bert chimed
in eagerly. &ldquo;There are lots of big tree branches
lying around. Looks as if they had been blown
down in some storm. We can use them for
levers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ve got the right idea, son,&rdquo; said
the man who had first spoken. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get
down to business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a work of time to place the stones in
the right position and to pick out branches that
would stand the strain. It proved a tremendous
task to lift the heavy car. At times they almost
despaired of moving it. However, it was that
very desperation that gave them strength at last.
Inch by inch, slowly, carefully, they finally forced
the great car upward, until with a sigh of relief
they realized that the task was finished.</p>

<p>The boys dropped to the ground, exhausted by
the unusual exertion. It doesn&rsquo;t take very long,
though, for strong, healthy boys to recover from
any strain, however great; so in a few minutes
they were again in the car and ready to start
for camp. It was too late to go further, and
after thanking the men for their help they started
back&mdash;slowly this time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>It was after dark when they reached the camp,
and Mr. Hollis, although confident of Bert&rsquo;s resourcefulness,
was beginning to be slightly worried
when the wanderers appeared at last upon the
scene.</p>

<p>In a very few moments the half-famished boys
were seated at a most appetizing meal, to which
they did full justice.</p>

<p>The rest of the fellows listened with the greatest
interest, while Tom related the adventure.
Bert and Mr. Hollis at a little distance discussed
the events of the day and planned to renew the
trip on the following morning.</p>

<p>It was only when everything was quiet in the
camp and the boys were supposed to be asleep,
that Tom, rising on his elbow, called out softly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello. Are you asleep over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just turning the corner,&rdquo; came a sleepy voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, stay on this side for a minute. I was
just thinking that in that wild ride we never even
looked for a place to pitch camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; came the voice, a little less
sleepy this time. &ldquo;Well, of all the boneheads
we&rsquo;re the limit. I always thought my head was
hard, but now I know it&rsquo;s solid. Oh, well,&rdquo; and
again the voice grew sleepy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have plenty
of time to-morrow to think of that. I&rsquo;m too
tired now. Good night. I&rsquo;ve just got to&mdash;turn&mdash;the&mdash;corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where Tom promptly joined him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Copperhead</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Bright and early next morning Bert awoke
to find the sunbeams playing all over his tent.
He noticed lazily what funny spots they made on
Tom&rsquo;s sleeping face. Then, with a start, he remembered
that Tom had grumbled the night before
because they would have to get up early to
catch a mess of fish for breakfast.</p>

<p>Thinking that he would wait a little while till
Tom woke up, he rolled off his cot on to the floor
so that he could command a view of the brook
through the open tent flap. He had just made
himself comfortable when an irritable voice
hailed him from the direction of Tom&rsquo;s cot:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you, Bert? What are you doing awake
at this unearthly hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same as yourself, I suppose,&rdquo; came the calm
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Well, you&rsquo;re not going to rout me
out at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a bear, Tom. We&rsquo;ve got to help
the fellows catch that fish and you know it, so
the sooner we start the better. A couple of the
fellows are down there now.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I suppose we&rsquo;ve got to, then, worse
luck. They probably will guy us unmercifully,
too, about yesterday. It&rsquo;s a wonder they didn&rsquo;t,
last night,&rdquo; which was all the credit the boys got
for trying to save the feelings of the reckless
volunteers.</p>

<p>As the two comrades ran swiftly down to the
water&rsquo;s edge, they noticed that Shorty&mdash;Philip
Strong had been nicknamed Shorty because of his
very small figure&mdash;was tugging hard at his line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a bite, Shorty?&rdquo; they shouted, when
they came within hailing distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet your life, and it&rsquo;s pulling like a good fellow,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better let me help; I&rsquo;m stronger than you,&rdquo;
offered Bob, who was sitting a little distance down
the bank and whose luck hadn&rsquo;t been of the best
up to that time.</p>

<p>Now, a very sore point with Shorty was his
lack of strength, and whenever anybody referred
to it, no matter with what good intentions, he
always bristled up as if at a personal insult. This
morning that very touchiness proved to be his undoing,
for, as he got to his feet, intending to inform
Bob that he could do very well without any
of his help, the fish gave a sudden jerk to the line
that made Shorty lose his balance and tumble
head-first into the water.</p>

<p>The boys, convulsed with laughter, fished him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
up, dripping and sheepish. Without thanking
the boys for their help, Shorty zig-zagged up to
the tent, making, it must be confessed, a rather
sorry figure. When they finally had managed to
get the line up they found that the cause of
Shorty&rsquo;s undoing had escaped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little Shorty, he&rsquo;s always getting into
trouble,&rdquo; one of the boys said when he had
breath enough.</p>

<p>Then, as the time was getting short, they all
settled down in good earnest to their task and,
before the camp was awake at half-past six, had
caught a &ldquo;corking mess,&rdquo; as they expressed it.</p>

<p>As each tent poured forth its several occupants,
the fishermen took their mornings catch to the
mess tent and went to report&mdash;some of them with
sinking hearts, it is to be feared&mdash;to Mr. Hollis.</p>

<p>However, the leader was very lenient with the
offenders, merely reprimanding their carelessness
and cautioning them not again to forget that they
had pledged their word of honor to render him
the most absolute obedience in every particular.</p>

<p>Upon the boys eagerly promising that they
wouldn&rsquo;t offend again and upon Bert&rsquo;s asking to
be allowed to have another chance to find the
camp site, permission was given and they sauntered
away, filled with the happy anticipation of
laurels still to be won.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
brought out and the original volunteers, their
ranks swelled by three new recruits, Shorty
among them, started off up the hill amid the
cheers and good wishes of the fellows.</p>

<p>For an hour they rode steadily up hill and
down dale until they saw far off through the
trees the faint gleam of water. Running the
auto into the woods for a short distance, they all
jumped out and started to investigate.</p>

<p>The boys thought they had never seen the
woods when they were as beautiful as on that
day. They had not gone very far before Bert,
who was in the lead, called back, &ldquo;Come here,
fellows and see this grove of chestnut trees.
Isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys all hurried forward and there, sure
enough, was a regular colony of chestnut trees,
their huge branches giving promise of abundant
harvest, when the frost came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, its a shame not to be able to
get any good out of these nuts that are sure to
be so plentiful in the fall. Don&rsquo;t you suppose we
might arrange to stay until the frost comes?&rdquo;
Shorty asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think we ought to be able to fix it
up,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;We can ask Mr. Hollis about
it anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they started again, on the lookout for
other finds. All the way along they came across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
numbers of clear, cold springs and never failed
to test each one. More than once they had to
cross brooks on stones that were not over steady
and, at one time, a very loose one nearly caused
Shorty another ducking.</p>

<p>At last they reached the border of the woods
and looked out upon a sight that held them spellbound.
There before them was a smooth, grassy
stretch of ground, dotted here and there with
beautiful, spreading oak trees. Sloping gently
down, it stopped at the edge of a clear, transparent
lake that reflected the radiant brightness
of the sun. On the other side the ground was
level for a short distance and then rose forming
a small hill, richly carpeted with low shrubs and
gorgeously colored wild flowers. Branches of
trees drooped low over the lake, as if trying to
catch their own reflections in its clear depths.
Birds twittered and sang in the branches, joyously
mingling their bubbling notes with the music
of a rippling brook near by. It seemed as
if the soft voice of Nature spoke to them in the
murmuring of the trees, sang to them in the song
of the birds, joyously called to them in the babble
of the brook, smiled a welcome to them from
the bright surface of the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Tom, drawing a long breath.
&ldquo;It sure is wonderful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Bert exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s by far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the most beautiful place I&rsquo;ve ever had the luck
to locate! Come on, fellows, let&rsquo;s take a look
around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So look around they did and found that every
thing about this ideal spot was all they could possibly
ask for&mdash;and more. After examining
everything in sight they found that they were
just about starved, so they sat down under one
of the trees near the lake and spread out the
contents of the lunch basket. After a feast of
chicken, canned salmon, cornbread, maple syrup,
and sweetened lemon juice, which, when mixed
with cold spring water made a very tempting
drink, they started off with the empty lunch
basket, the latter being, as one of the boys remarked,
&ldquo;a heap sight lighter than it was when
we started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;but I feel
a heap sight heavier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have eaten so much,&rdquo; Shorty
reproved him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d eaten as much as you have, Philip
Strong,&rdquo; Frank retorted, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to
walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of eating,&rdquo; said Shorty, sniffing the
air inquiringly, &ldquo;do any of you fellows smell
cucumbers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Shorty? Has the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
ducking you indulged in this morning addled your
brains? Whoever heard of cucumbers in the
woods?&rdquo; said Frank contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it sounds foolish but it&rsquo;s the truth
just the same,&rdquo; and Shorty stood his ground
stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shorty&rsquo;s right, boys: I noticed the cucumber
smell quite a while ago and it seems to grow
stronger the farther we go,&rdquo; said Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George, that&rsquo;s so! I smell it myself,
now.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do, too.&rdquo; &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo; and various
other exclamations of the same sort showed that
Shorty was right.</p>

<p>The boys scattered all over trying to locate
the odor, which was very strong at this time.
Tom was the first to discover the cause of it.
At his low, imperative, &ldquo;Come here quick, fellows,
but don&rsquo;t make a noise,&rdquo; they all ran to
see what was the matter.</p>

<p>Excitedly he pointed to a long, copper-colored
snake, that seemed to be watching a bird&rsquo;s nest
built low in one of the bushes. The mother bird
was hovering distractedly over her nest, uttering
shrill, excited cries that brought her mate to her
side. Just then the snake coiled ready to strike
and the boys looked around desperately for stones
but Bert had gotten ahead of them. As soon as
he had seen what was happening he had slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
noiselessly away to a brook they had just passed
and, snatching up a heavy stone, had hurried
back to the scene of the tragedy. So, as soon
as the snake had its head in a position to strike
he hurled the stone directly at it. Slowly and
convulsively the snake untwined and finally lay
still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange I didn&rsquo;t think of that cucumber
smell being caused by a copperhead,&rdquo; said Bert;
&ldquo;I used to kill them every once in a while
when I was at my uncle&rsquo;s farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then, Tom called their attention to the
mother bird. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it almost seem as if she
were thanking us?&rdquo; And it really did seem so.
The little bird had settled back on her nest with
her black eyes fixed gratefully on her rescuers
and making little, low, gurgling noises way down
in her throat. Nearby on a low branch the
father bird was swaying back and forth, pouring
out his musical notes straight from a little heart
bursting with gratitude and joy.</p>

<p>Leaving the happy family to its own devices,
the boys took up the trail again. In high spirits,
they chased each other over fallen logs and
through the dense foliage, peered into squirrels&rsquo;
holes and rabbits&rsquo; burrows, commented upon the
appearance and habits of the sly little chipmunk
and other interesting, woodland creatures.</p>

<p>Before they realized it they had come upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; standing just as they had left it in
its leafy garage.</p>

<p>While they were on the way home they examined
the snake skin. It was a beauty of its
kind. It was about a yard long and the sixteen
copper-red, moccasin-shaped stripes were very
clearly defined.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached camp they gave in
their report to Mr. Hollis. The boys all
crowded around, eager to hear about the snake
and camp site. The heroes of the day were
deluged with questions. &ldquo;How did you get
it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you found a good place for
camp?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;What does it look
like?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Hollis, seeing how tired and
hungry they were, came to their rescue, proposing
that they eat their supper first and save the
tale of adventure until the camp council. At
first they agreed rather hesitatingly but, as an
appetizing smell issued forth from the mess tent,
they found that they couldn&rsquo;t get there fast
enough.</p>

<p>After supper the boys made a roaring fire and
squatted around it, waiting for the roll-call.
Then Mr. Hollis called the roll, beginning with
Adams and ending with Taylor. As everybody
was there, the reports were called for. Every
boy reported his adventures and experiences during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the day; all of which would have been intensely
interesting to the boys as a rule, but they
were so anxious to hear Bert&rsquo;s report that they
passed over the others rapidly.</p>

<p>When at last Bert&rsquo;s turn came, they all crowded
forward with eager interest, and they were not
disappointed. Bert told his story simply and
well, and was not once interrupted.</p>

<p>When the tale was finished the boys fairly
exploded. Cries of &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo; &ldquo;Everything
is sure going our way this year,&rdquo; mingled
with &ldquo;How did you manage to get the stone
without the snake hearing you?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are
you going to do with the skin now that you&rsquo;ve
got it?&rdquo; And to all Bert gave a satisfactory
answer.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the boys could quiet
down and even then they felt like hearing something
exciting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can tell a good ghost story?&rdquo; Bob
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dave&rsquo;s the boy. Come on, Dave, put on
your thinking cap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dave Ferris had been elected official story
teller at the beginning, because he always had a
stock on hand, and they were generally thrilling
tales of adventure or weird ghost stories, the kind
that boys always revel in.</p>

<p>Dave was silent, thinking for a little while.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Then he said, &ldquo;All right boys, here goes. Are
you ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To a chorus of &ldquo;Sure thing, fire away, and
break the speed limit,&rdquo; they all gathered closer
together around the fire and Dave began his
story.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Challenge</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Dave certainly could not complain of a bored
or indifferent audience. Even Mr. Hollis
was absorbed and listened with a smile on his
kindly face. He was always intensely interested
in anything the boys said or did, and was never
happier than when he saw that they were especially
enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>Dave had just reached the most thrilling part
of his story, and in their imaginations the boys
could hear the wailings of the ghost and the
clanking of his chains. He was describing the
awful appearance of its sunken fiery eyes, when
Shorty happened to glance apprehensively around
and immediately emitted a blood-curdling yell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghost! The ghost!&rdquo; he stammered,
pointing in the direction of the road. All leaped
to their feet and followed the direction of
Shorty&rsquo;s trembling finger, and for a moment
even Bert Wilson felt a queer little tightening
sensation about the heart, for there, apparently
coming directly toward them, were the fiery eyes
that Dave had just described with such gusto.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you simps,&rdquo; laughed Bert, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s no
ghost, or if it is, it is the most solid spook I
ever heard of. Those are the acetylene lamps
of another auto,&rdquo; and as he spoke he exchanged
significant glances with Mr. Hollis.</p>

<p>Somewhat ashamed of having been so startled,
the boys now fell to guessing at the mission of
the strange car. They had not long to wait.
In a few minutes they could hear the purring of
its exhaust, and soon a great gray automobile
dashed into camp and drew up in front of the
fire.</p>

<p>From it descended a genial looking man, apparently
of about the same age as Mr. Hollis,
followed by five clean cut young fellows.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis and Mr. Thompson, as the new
comer&rsquo;s name proved to be, evidently knew each
other and shook hands heartily. Meanwhile the
camp boys mingled with their unexpected guests
and with the freemasonry of youth soon became
chummy.</p>

<p>The only fault perhaps that could be found
with the new arrivals was that they seemed to be
a trifle overbearing, and evidently thought that
their car, which they called the &ldquo;Gray Ghost,&rdquo;
could beat any other automobile ever made.</p>

<p>It is needless to state that Bert&rsquo;s crowd felt
the same way regarding the &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; so
that the boys were soon engaged in a heated argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
concerning the respective merits of their
cars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; maintained Tom, hotly, &ldquo;you fellows
have no idea what our &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; can do in
the way of speed and hill climbing. Just to-day
we were out on a run and, though I didn&rsquo;t
actually time it, I am dead sure there were
stretches where we did as well as a mile a minute.
What do you think of that?&rdquo; he asked triumphantly.</p>

<p>Indeed, this seemed to cool the visitors down
somewhat and they exchanged surprised glances.
But they soon recovered their confidence and
went on to describe the speed qualities of their
car with ever-increasing enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just a short time ago,&rdquo; said one whose
name turned out to be Ralph Quinby, &ldquo;that we
took the &lsquo;Gray Ghost&rsquo; around the old race track
just outside the town, and we averaged over fifty
miles an hour. We could have gone much faster
too, only Mr. Thompson would not let us. I&rsquo;ll
just bet your auto couldn&rsquo;t go as fast as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was now the turn of their hosts to look
doubtful. They were sure, however, that the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; could hold its own with any other
car, and as they thought of their idolized driver,
Bert Wilson, their confidence came back with a
rush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Tom, drawing a long breath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
&ldquo;you fellows evidently think you could win in
a race and we just <i>know</i> that we could, so I guess
the only way to settle the dispute is to run off a
race somewhere and prove which is the better
machine. I know we&rsquo;d be willing if you would,
wouldn&rsquo;t we, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of approving shouts from
his companions, but the visitors only smiled in a
superior fashion, and evidently thought there
could be but one conclusion to any race in which
their car was entered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Hollis and Mr. Thompson
were holding an earnest conversation in which
the latter seemed to be urging some point about
which Mr. Hollis apparently hesitated. In fact,
Mr. Thompson was trying to get Mr. Hollis to
give his consent to a race between the cars owned
by the two camps. But the latter thought that
it would involve too much risk for the boys who
drove the machines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;you
and I, Thompson, are responsible for the safety
of these boys. We both feel toward them as
though they belonged to us and if anything happened
to them we would never forgive ourselves.
It seems to me too big a risk to take merely for
the sake of seeing who owns the faster car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re dead right there, of course,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Thompson, &ldquo;but then I don&rsquo;t think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the risk is so great as you imagine. I have seen
the track they would use, provided the race was
run, and I think there would be little, if any,
danger. The track has not been used for several
years and most of the fence is missing, so that
if they ran off the course itself, it would only be
a matter of running over the grass until they
stopped. You know me well enough to realize
that I would not sanction anything that contained
too large an element of peril. As for the
slight risk that undoubtedly exists, it seems to
me that it would not hurt the boys to take it,
and it would teach them self-reliance and confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as that goes,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis, smiling
reluctantly, &ldquo;my boys have too much confidence
in themselves and I have to be constantly
curbing their tendencies toward taking chances.
However, I have every confidence in your judgment,
so I suppose I might as well consent this
once. I wish to have it understood, however,
that this is the last as well as the first race they
ever run, win or lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That suits me all right, so I guess we can
consider it settled,&rdquo; answered Mr. Thompson,
&ldquo;what do you say to going over and having a
look at the machines? You haven&rsquo;t seen our
car yet, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s a pleasure still in store for me,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
replied Mr. Hollis; and the two men rose and
strolled over to where the cars stood, their brass
work glittering in the light of the dancing campfire.</p>

<p>By this time most of the boys had gathered
around the cars, but they saluted and made way
respectfully for their leaders as they came up.
They both smiled when they saw Bert and Ralph
Quinby, for they were so engrossed in the discussion
of the respective merits and appliances
of their cars that they did not even notice the
coming of their leaders.</p>

<p>Such terms as &ldquo;gear ratios,&rdquo; &ldquo;revolutions per
minute&rdquo; and &ldquo;three point suspension&rdquo; filled the
air, and Mr. Hollis whispered to Mr. Thompson:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager that those boys saturate their
handkerchiefs with gasoline, so that whenever
they get a block away from a machine they can
smell gasoline and feel at home again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they did,&rdquo; laughed
Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you fellows come out of your trance,&rdquo;
called Dick, and Bert and Ralph turned quickly
around and saluted.</p>

<p>Their leaders returned the salute, and Mr.
Thompson said: &ldquo;Well, I suppose both you
boys think you have a pretty fast machine there.
How would you like to have a test of speed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of excited cries and exclamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
from the boys, and their leaders
smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>Bert stepped forward and said: &ldquo;I think,
sir, that I speak for Mr. Quinby as well as myself
when I say that nothing would suit us better.&rdquo;
Ralph gave a nod of assent and Bert went on:
&ldquo;We will both promise to be cautious, and I
think if we take proper precautions we will be
able to run off a good race without an accident.
How long do you think the race ought to
be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long is the track that you propose
using?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Hollis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s just one mile, isn&rsquo;t it Ralph?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Ralph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson,
&ldquo;that ten miles, that is ten full laps around the
track, ought to be about right. Will that be
satisfactory to you, Mr. Hollis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can see no objection to that,&rdquo; replied
the latter, &ldquo;what day shall we have the race?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would a week from today suit you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see, that will be Tuesday, won&rsquo;t it?
I guess that will be satisfactory to all concerned.
How do you boys feel about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They voiced a unanimous assent to these arrangements,
and both sides started discussing the
various chances and possibilities of the contest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
but with perfect good humor and friendly feeling.</p>

<p>It was now getting late, however, and the
discipline of the camps could not be too much relaxed,
even in the face of such an important event
as this. Accordingly, hearty farewells were exchanged,
and the visitors climbed into their big
gray car.</p>

<p>All the boys gathered around expectantly to
note the behavior of the car when it started,
and it must be admitted that even Bert Wilson&rsquo;s
expert eye could find no defect in the handling or
running of the rival machine. Ralph started it
smoothly and without a jerk, and soon all they
could see of it was the angry gleam of its red
tail-light.</p>

<p>As they turned away to prepare for sleep,
Jim remarked: &ldquo;Aw, I bet we&rsquo;ll have a walkover
in that race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert knew better, however, and was convinced
that he would have to use every ounce of power
that the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; possessed to beat the &ldquo;Gray
Ghost.&rdquo; But one thing he was sure of, and that
was that whoever won it was going to be a
mighty close race. He did not make the mistake
of underrating his rival, as so many boys in his
position would have done, but made up his mind
to do the very best he could, right from the
start.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>For a long time he stood staring at the &ldquo;Red
Scout,&rdquo; and then raised its shining hood and patted
the spotless cylinders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we can do it, old boy, but you will
have to stand by me and work as you have never
worked before,&rdquo; he said, and gently lowered the
hood and walked off toward his tent.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Hoboes and the Bees</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Early in the morning the boys began to break
camp and start for the new location.
Groups of three or four were detailed by Mr.
Hollis to accomplish certain tasks and they
started to carry out his directions right merrily.
Some were sent to store the provisions and cooking
utensils; others to take down the tents and
gather together their blankets and other bedding;
still others got together the fishing tackle
and all was done to the accompaniment of songs
and jests and laughter, so that before they knew
it everything was ready to dump into the old
farm wagons they had hired for the purpose.
When everything was packed in the wagon that
would possibly go in, Mr. Hollis selected Tom
to ride beside the driver and show him where
to go.</p>

<p>After the wagon had started off, some of the
boys&rsquo; own personal belongings that were left
over were put in the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; and seven of the
fellows scrambled in someway&mdash;trust boys to
find room if there is any to be found&mdash;and started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
away after the wagon. They soon passed it and
went on until they came to the turn in the road
where the lake could be dimly seen through the
trees. There Bert stopped and the boys got out,
taking the packages with them. Shorty had been
detailed to lead them to the lake and then to come
back and wait for the farm wagon.</p>

<p>Then Bert went back to pick up Mr. Hollis
and Dick Trent who had stayed behind to see
that nothing had been forgotten.</p>

<p>On the way back he passed the wagon and
hailed Tom with a &ldquo;How are you getting along,
old man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty badly, I thank you. I wish Mr. Hollis
had picked out somebody else for this job&mdash;someone
who didn&rsquo;t care if he spent hours getting
nowhere,&rdquo; Tom replied sourly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, the worst is yet to come,&rdquo; laughed
Bert. &ldquo;Never mind, even the worst trials have
to end some time,&rdquo; he added consolingly and
started off again while Tom looked enviously
after the red car, now fast disappearing in the
distance.</p>

<p>When Bert reached the old camp site, now
looking very bare and forlorn, he found Mr.
Hollis and the boys waiting impatiently for him.
Mr. Hollis and Dick got in, followed by six of
the boys. Bert promised to come back for the
rest right away and the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; started off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with its second load. In a little while, for Bert
had found a second and much shorter road to the
lake, they came once more to &ldquo;Campers&rsquo; Crossing&rdquo;
as the boys had named it. There they
found that the wagon had just arrived with its
load, but the boys had delayed unloading it until
Mr. Hollis should reach the scene of action. In
a minute the Camp Master had taken charge and
the boys were busy unloading and carrying everything
to the camp.</p>

<p>Once more Bert started back with the reliable
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; for his last load. When he got to
the old camp the boys greeted him with the news
that Jim Dawson had disappeared and couldn&rsquo;t
be found anywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was here just a few minutes ago,&rdquo; said
Steve Thomas. &ldquo;But when I went to ask him
a question just now he was gone. We have
hunted high and low but we can&rsquo;t find a trace of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert was troubled at first, but suddenly a
thought struck him and his face lighted up as he
exclaimed: &ldquo;I think I can explain the mystery.
Follow me, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led them through a dense thicket to the
side of a hill, covered with underbrush. Pulling
a bush aside, he disclosed to the boys&rsquo; astonished
gaze, a great, black hole which was evidently
the mouth of a cave.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on out, Jim,&rdquo; Bert called. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
want to keep Mr. Hollis waiting <i>too</i> long, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Dawson was one of those hungry boys
who never can get enough to eat, so, having discovered
the cave one day, while chasing a butterfly,
he had secretly brought food there in a
tin box, so that if he chanced to get hungry, he
always had something to eat at hand.</p>

<p>Bert had discovered the cave and its secret
long ago but he was not given to tale-bearing
and so had kept his own counsel.</p>

<p>As Bert spoke, a sound was heard inside the
cave, and, in a minute, out came the culprit with
an accusing piece of cornbread in his hand, blinking
like an owl brought suddenly into the glare
of the sun.</p>

<p>At the look of complete surprise and dismay
on his face the boys burst into a shout of
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you lemon,&rdquo; gasped Steve. &ldquo;You full-sized
lemon! How did you ever manage to get
away with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder we have been short of grub,
lately,&rdquo; Dave said, holding his sides as if he
were afraid he would burst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t leave a fellow
alone,&rdquo; said Jim, sulkily. &ldquo;I only brought
grub here that belonged to me.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sore, Jim,&rdquo; Bert said, good-naturedly.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have disturbed you if we
hadn&rsquo;t been in a hurry. That reminds me that
we&rsquo;ve wasted a good deal of valuable time, already.
I guess we had better be getting along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that they all started back on the run and
soon had Jim in such a good humor that he even
told them how he had escaped being found out
by a narrow margin many a time, and that nobody
but Bert had even suspected the cave&rsquo;s existence.</p>

<p>They all piled into the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; in a hurry
because they feared that Mr. Hollis would worry
on account of their prolonged absence.</p>

<p>They arrived at &ldquo;Campers&rsquo; Crossing&rdquo; just in
time to carry the last barrel of provisions. When
they reached the new camp the boys were surprised
to see how much had been done in their
absence. The tents had been set up and from
the mess tent came the clattering of utensils
and the savory odor of creamed salmon on
toast.</p>

<p>Soon, the call to dinner was heard, and the
boys all gathered around the table, chattering
like magpies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as if we&rsquo;d always camped here,&rdquo;
said Shorty. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about the
place that makes you feel at home right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the classiest place I&rsquo;ve ever been in,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Dave Ferris declared, enthusiastically. &ldquo;It
makes you imagine that Nature might have had
a little time on her hands and devoted it to
making this one spot a little paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; Tom cried, clapping his
hands in mock praise. &ldquo;Dave will be a poet if
he doesn&rsquo;t look out. Give us some more, old
man, the sample&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be careful how you</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Beard the lion in his den<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ferris in his hall,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">said Dick Trent, warningly. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t favor
us with any more stories if you are not careful
how you offend him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon he&rsquo;d spout all the poetry he
wants to if it relieves him any, as long as he
doesn&rsquo;t forget how to tell stories,&rdquo; Shorty remarked
as he contentedly munched a piece of
toast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very kind of you,&rdquo; said Dave, sarcastically.
&ldquo;I thank you with all my heart for
your liberality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My which? Say, Dave, if that ever belonged
to me, I call you all to witness that I disown
it from this time on. It&rsquo;s no friend of mine
from this time on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better hang on to it, Shorty. It&rsquo;s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
best kind of thing to have around at times,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hollis, as he rose to leave the table.</p>

<p>In the afternoon scouting parties were sent
out in all directions to find out the nature of the
surrounding country. Steve Thomas, Bert,
Tom, Bob, Shorty, and Jim Dawson were sent
off to scour the woods in an easterly direction
from the lake.</p>

<p>For a considerable distance they tramped
along, talking of the different plants and shrubs
they came across and naming the birds they saw
in the trees. They threw peanuts to the squirrels
that peeped inquiringly at them from
branches over their heads or ventured shyly from
the shelter of their holes. They imitated the
clear notes of the birds until the little songsters
paused to look wonderingly at these strange
creatures that could not fly and yet sang like
themselves. Timid little rabbits watched the
boys with soft, brown eyes, not knowing whether
or not to sally forth from their security even for
the tempting carrot that Bert held out so coaxingly.
When he threw it at a distance, however,
one little fellow, braver than the others, his appetite
overcoming his fears, ran forth quickly,
snatched the carrot and scurried back in a panic
to his burrow, where, with his bright eyes fixed
on these humans who had been so kind to him, he
ate contentedly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the quiet woods rang with shouts
and cries, the barking of a dog and the noise of
people running to and fro furiously. Alarmed,
the boys started on a run for the place from which
the cries seemed to come. They fairly gasped
when they came upon the cause of all the commotion.
<a href="#image02">Three men, of the roughest order, were
dancing distractedly around</a>, trying to beat off a
swarm of bees that surrounded them, and yelling
like mad, while a big collie dog, wild with
excitement, barked with all his might.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">

<br /><span class="caption"><a href="#Page_46">Three men of the roughest order were dancing distractedly around.</a></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Say, this is better than a circus,&rdquo; Shorty
shouted, &ldquo;only I&rsquo;m glad that those hoboes and
not I are the whole show now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Shorty. The question now, is, what
we can do to help the poor fellows out,&rdquo; said
Tom; then, turning to the tramps, he yelled,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better make a dive for the brook and
get under water. It&rsquo;s right through the trees
to your left,&rdquo; he added, as the men, now nearly
crazy with pain, started to follow his advice.</p>

<p>Rushing frantically to the brook, they plunged
in head first, while the bees, deprived of their
prey, flew off angrily into the woods to search for
new victims upon whom they might vent their
spite. When the tramps came up, dripping from
the water, they were a sight to behold. Their
faces were swollen so that their eyes seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
mere slits and their ears appeared to be twice
their natural size.</p>

<p>The boys at once ran to get mud to put on the
red, angry wounds. The tramps submitted with
indifferent grace to the treatment, grumbling that
they &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t see what good being all smeared up
with mud was going to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the boys had done what they could
to ease the pain, the tramps declared that they
would have to be moving on &ldquo;because them pesky
critters might come back to finish up their business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the boys watched the strange company of
sullen, muttering men disappear through the
trees. As they were lost to view, the comical
side of the adventure struck Shorty and he began
to laugh and the longer he laughed, the harder
he laughed. The others caught the infection
and in a second the woods were ringing with the
unrestrained roars of the boys. They laughed
until they could laugh no more and then lay on
the grass, gasping for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they did look <i>so</i> funny!&rdquo; said Shorty between
gasps. &ldquo;I never shall forget that sight
until my dying day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that minute Bert sat up suddenly, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Fellows, look who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one accord they turned and saw the collie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which they had entirely forgotten, sitting near
and regarding them with inquiring, wistful eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Beauty,&rdquo; Bert called, and the
dog came unhesitatingly and stuck his cold, black
muzzle in Bert&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they desert you, old fellow?&rdquo; Bert
asked, putting his arm around the dog&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>The collie waved his beautiful brush and, lifting
his soft eyes to Bert&rsquo;s face saw something
there that made him his slave forevermore. For
the collie, with true dog instinct, had recognized
that in Bert he had a friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder where those tramps got him.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Probably swiped him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look as if
he&rsquo;d had very good treatment.&rdquo; &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
and it&rsquo;s a shame, too. Isn&rsquo;t he a beauty?&rdquo; were
some of the comments of the boys as they gathered
around the dog, patting his head gently.
The collie waved his tail and in his eyes was a
great longing for sympathy and love. And you
may be sure the boys gave him what he asked
for.</p>

<p>Tired out, the boys finally went back to camp,
followed by their new friend who soon became
a favorite with everyone. That night Don, as
they called the dog, sat with the rest around the
camp fire and answered whenever they spoke to
him with a wave of his silver brush. Bert made
him a bed on the floor of his tent and Don gladly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
took possession of it. Just before he got into
bed Bert put his hand on the dog&rsquo;s head, saying,
&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re going to be good friends aren&rsquo;t
we, old fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Don, looking up in his master&rsquo;s face, with
eyes that held a world of gratitude and love, answered
to Bert&rsquo;s entire satisfaction.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Shorty Goes to the Ant</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The next morning, when the boys drew aside
the flaps of their tents, the sky was dark
and lowering. A good many anxious glances
were thrown at the clouds and open disapproval
of the outlook was not slow in breaking out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, what a fearful day,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet it is,&rdquo; chimed in Shorty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our luck,&rdquo; wailed Dave, &ldquo;just when
I wanted to go to town to get a new blade for
the jack-knife I broke yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come off, you pessimists,&rdquo; sang out Bert,
who had just plunged his head in a bucket of cold
water and now was rubbing his face until it
shone, &ldquo;somewhere the sun is shining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heap of good that does us,&rdquo; grumbled
Shorty, &ldquo;but say,&rdquo; as he turned to Bert suspiciously,
&ldquo;what sort of thing was that you called
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said you were pessimists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what does that jawbreaker mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Bert, who could not resist his
propensity to tease, &ldquo;that means that you are not
optimists.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse and worse and more of it,&rdquo; complained
Shorty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just as clear as mud,&rdquo; echoed Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert, tantalizingly, &ldquo;listen my
children&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Listen, my children and you shall hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">chanted Frank, who had recited that identical
poem in his elocution class at the last term of
school.</p>

<p>A well-aimed pillow made him duck, and Bert
resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Shorty, it&rsquo;s just like this: The optimist
is the fellow that sees the doughnut. The
pessimist sees only the hole in the doughnut.
Now, for my part, there is no nourishment in the
hole, but there&rsquo;s lots of it in the doughnut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw say, don&rsquo;t make a fellow&rsquo;s mouth water,&rdquo;
said Shorty, before whose practical vision rose
up his mother&rsquo;s kitchen, fragrant with the smell
of the crisp, brown, sizzling beauties, as they
were lifted from the pan, &ldquo;and me so far from
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If there were no doughnuts at the breakfast to
which all hands came running, their place was
more than taken by the golden corn bread and
the savory bacon that formed the meal to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
they sat down with all the enthusiasm of hungry
boys. The food disappeared as if by magic and
the table had been replenished more than once
before the boys cried enough. Many a sated
millionaire would have willingly exchanged a substantial
part of his hoarded wealth for one of
those unjaded appetites. But in pure, undiluted
satisfaction, the boys would have been the losers
by the exchange.</p>

<p>That very thought struck Mr. Hollis as he
watched the havoc made at table by these valiant
young trenchermen, and, turning to Dick, who
sat at his right, he spoke of the starving King
Midas. Jim, who overheard the name, which,
as he said &ldquo;was a new one on him,&rdquo; wanted to
know who Midas was, and how, if he were a
king, he couldn&rsquo;t get grub enough to keep him
from starving. The boys, who had by this time
taken the first keen edge off their appetite, were
equally eager to hear the story, and Mr. Hollis
went on to tell about the avaricious king of the
olden time who could never get enough, but was
always asking the gods for more. After a
while they became wearied and disgusted and
granted his request that everything he touched
should turn to gold. The king was delighted at
this beyond all measure. Now, at last, he was
to have his heart&rsquo;s desire. He put the gift to
the test at once. He touched his sword and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
changed to gold. That was fine. He stroked
his beard and every hair became a glistening yellow
spike. That wasn&rsquo;t so fine. He began to
get a little worried. Wasn&rsquo;t this too much of a
good thing? Well, anyway there was no use in
fretting. He would go to dinner and get his
mind off. But when he touched the food, it too
became gold. He lifted a goblet of wine, only
to find that it held molten metal. In the midst
of plenty, he was starving. Upon his knees, he
begged the gods to take back their fatal gift,
and, thinking he had learned his lesson well, they
did so. His gold vanished, but, oh, how delicious
was the first taste of food. &ldquo;And to-day,&rdquo; concluded
Mr. Hollis, &ldquo;there is many a millionaire
whose gold doesn&rsquo;t give him the pleasure that a
square meal gives the ravenous appetite of a
healthy boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, expressing the general sentiment,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure like the money, but, oh, you
corn bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After breakfast, the boys broke up into separate
groups. One went off under the guidance
of Mr. Hollis to gather some fossils that were
to be found in great abundance in the limestone
that jutted out from a quarry at a little distance
from the camp. Another group of the fellows
with Dick in charge, who were especially interested
in bird and insect life&mdash;the &ldquo;bug squad&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
as they were commonly and irreverently referred
to in camp&mdash;went to a little clearing about half
a mile away that was especially rich in specimens.
The day before, Tom had secured an uncommonly
beautiful species of butterfly that topped
anything in his experience so far, and the other
boys wanted to add one to their rapidly growing
collection. Whether the lowering day had anything
to do or not with the absence of these fluttering
beauties who love the sunshine, their
search was without result, and after two hours
spent in this way they threw aside their butterfly
nets and sat down in the shade of a spreading
beech to rest and as Shorty called it &ldquo;to have a
gabfest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost directly beneath the eastern branches
was a large mound nearly three feet above the
surrounding level and perhaps twenty feet in circumference.
As Shorty flung himself down on
the centre of the mound, a curious expression
came into the eyes of Dick. He glanced quickly
at Frank, who returned his look and added a
wink that might have aroused suspicion in
Shorty&rsquo;s mind, had not that guileless youth been
lying stretched out at full length with his hat
over his eyes. The warmth and general mugginess
of the air saturated almost to the raining
point, together with the constant activity of the
last two hours, had tired him out, and after a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
badinage growing less and less spirited, he began
to doze. The other boys who had been
given the tip by Frank and Dick, let the conversation
drag on purpose, and with a wicked glint
of mischief in their eyes watched the unsuspecting
Shorty slip away into the land of sleep.
Soon his arms relaxed, his chest rose and fell
with his regular breathing and horrors! an undeniable
snore told that Shorty was not
&ldquo;faking,&rdquo; but was off for good.</p>

<p>From being a spot of perfect peace and quiet,
the mound suddenly burst into life. From numberless
gates a swarm of ants issued forth and
rushed about here and there to find out the
cause of this invasion. The weight of Shorty&rsquo;s
body and his movements as he composed himself
for sleep had aroused them to a sense of danger
and they poured out in thousands. Soon the
ground was covered with little patches of black
and red ants, and as though by common consent
they began to surround the unconscious Shorty.
Some crept up his legs, others his arms, while
others climbed over his collar and slipped inside.</p>

<p>First, an arm twitched violently. Then a
sleepy hand stole down and scratched his leg.
The boys were bursting with laughter, and Tim
grew black in the face as he crowded his handkerchief
into his mouth. Shorty shook his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
as a horse does when a fly lights on it. Again he
twitched and this time seemed to realize that
there was something wrong. Still half asleep, he
snapped:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, why don&rsquo;t you fellows quit your kidding?
Stop tickling me with that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A yell ended the sentence as a nip more vicious
than usual brought Shorty to his feet, this time
wide awake beyond all question. He cast one
glance at the boys, who now made no pretence
of restraint but roared with laughter. Then he
saw the swarm of ants surrounding him and took
in the situation. He tore his hat from his head,
his coat from his shoulders, shook off his tormentors
and spinning around like a dancing dervish,
dashed off toward the brook. A moment
later there was a splash and they heard Shorty
blowing, spluttering, diving, rubbing, until finally
he had rid himself of the swarms that clung
closer to him than a brother.</p>

<p>At last he succeeded and came up the bank.
Before resuming his clothes, he had to take each
garment separately and search every seam and
crease to make sure that not a single ant remained.
Then he came back into the group like
a raging lion. His temper never was any of the
best, and the sudden awakening from sleep, the
stings and ticklings of the invaders, and perhaps
most of all, the unrestrained laughter of the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had filled his cup to the brim. He &ldquo;saw red,&rdquo; as
the saying is, and regardless of age and size was
rushing toward the rest with doubled up fists and
rage in his heart, when Dick caught him by
the wrists and held him in his strong grasp until
his fury had spent itself somewhat and he began
to get control of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; said Dick&mdash;he never called him
Shorty, and at this moment that recollection
helped to sober the struggling boy&mdash;&ldquo;remember
that the first duty of boy or man is to control his
temper. The boys didn&rsquo;t mean any harm. It
looked to them like a splendid joke, and perhaps
we let it go a little too far. I am really to blame
more than any one else because I am older and
in charge of the squad. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Phil,
and I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kindly tone and sincere apology were not
lost on Phil, who was not without a sense of
humor, which through all his anger began to
struggle to the surface. The other boys, too,
thoughtless and impulsive though they might be,
were sound and kind at heart, and following
Dick&rsquo;s example crowded about Phil and joined
in the apology. The most flaming anger must
melt before such expressions of regard and goodwill
and Phil was at last compelled to smile
sheepishly and say that it was all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sport, Phil, all right,&rdquo; called out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Frank, and at this highest of commendations from
a boy&rsquo;s point of view, the last vestige of Phil&rsquo;s
resentment faded away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, fellows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
bear any grudge against you, but I am sure going
to get even with those pesky ants. I never
did care much for ants anyway. I&rsquo;ve been told
so often to &lsquo;go to the ant, thou sluggard,&rsquo; that
now I&rsquo;m going to them for fair, and what I do
to them will be a plenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this, he turned toward the ant hill
as though to demolish it, but Dick put up a
friendly hand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Phil,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t destroy
a wonderful and beautiful palace, would
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Palace,&rdquo; said Phil in amazement, thinking
for a moment that Dick was &ldquo;stringing&rdquo; him.
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; returned Dick; &ldquo;a wonderful
and beautiful palace. There is a queen
there and she walks about every day in state, surrounded
by a throng of courtiers. There are
princesses there that are taken out daily to get the
air, accompanied by a governess, exactly as you
have seen a group of boarding-school girls walking
out with their teachers. Surrounding the palace
is a city where there are hundreds of carpenters
and farmers and sentinels and soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
If you waited round a while, you would see the
farmers going out to milk their cows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, Dick was interrupted by a roar
of laughter that burst from every boy at once.
They had listened in growing amazement that
had rapidly become stupefaction, but this was
really too much. What was the matter with
Dick? Was it a joke, a parable, a fairy story?
They might be kids all right, but there was a limit
to everything, and when Dick talked of ants going
out to milk the cows&mdash;well! It was up to him to
explain himself or prove his statement, and that
they felt sure he could never do.</p>

<p>Dick waited good-naturedly while they pelted
him with objections and plied him with questions.
Then he took from his kit a strong magnifying
glass and told them that he was going to prove
to them all what he had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He laughs best who laughs last,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I am going to show you that all I said is
true. That is,&rdquo; he modified, &ldquo;I cannot <i>prove</i>
everything just now, as I would have to destroy
this wonderful palace if I were to try to show you
how marvelous it is and how perfect in all its
appointments. But what we don&rsquo;t see ourselves
has been seen time and time again by hundreds
of wise and truthful men, and their testimony
is as strong as though it were given under oath
in a court of law.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to take
everything else on faith, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;d have
to see the milking done myself in order to believe
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;as it happens that is
just the thing I can show you more easily than
anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys crowded eagerly around him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Ants Go Milking</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Dick, as the boys threw
themselves down at the side of the mound
and looked at it with an entirely new interest,
&ldquo;if these were African ants, you wouldn&rsquo;t be taking
any such liberties with them. Instead of
hanging around this mound you would be running
away like all possessed. And if you didn&rsquo;t
make tracks in a hurry the only thing left here
would be your skeleton picked as clean as the one
you saw the other day in old Dr. Sanford&rsquo;s
office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Jim, &ldquo;do you mean to say
that I would run away from a little thing like an
ant. Not on your life, I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d run away from
a boa-constrictor, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;d run away from the boa-constrictor,
and he&rsquo;d run away from the ants, where
do <i>you</i> get any license to face the ants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that those monster
snakes are afraid of such tiny things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say they were,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ants go from place to place through the great
African forest in countless numbers, millions at
a time, a regular army of them. Nothing can
stand before them. They strip every shrub, eat
every blade of grass. They swarm over every
living thing they find in their way. Sometimes
they come across a snake unawares, and climb
all over him. He squirms and twists and rushes
away, trying to brush them off, against the
bushes. At last he turns and bites frantically,
but they never let up. They actually eat him
alive, and in less than ten minutes they pass on
leaving his bones picked clean as a whistle. The
natives take their wives and children and flee for
their lives whenever they see an army of ants
approaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that, of course, has nothing to do with
these little American neighbors of ours. They
are perfectly harmless and though they are fierce
scrappers among themselves, inflict no injury on
any one else. And there is nothing in the whole
animal or insect world, except perhaps the bees,
that have a society and government so much like
that of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In one respect they are like their African
brothers and that is in their fondness for travel.
Every once in a while they make up their minds
to emigrate and then they fly in swarms of millions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; interrupted Frank, &ldquo;do you mean
to say they fly? I never knew that an ant had
wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they have,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;they
often have to cross rivers to get to their new
home. How could they do that without wings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; hummed Shorty:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The bed bug has no wings at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he gets there just the same.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A rather severe glance from Dick quenched
Phil&rsquo;s exuberant spirits which had all come back
to him since his ducking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;these swarms are
sometimes so vast that they darken the sun in
certain localities. Men working on high buildings
have been surrounded and almost blinded by
them. While these emigrations last they are a
bother, if not a peril, and the only ones that are
really happy are the fish in the brooks and rivers
over which they pass. Sometimes the surface is
fairly black with them and the trout and little
troutlings have the time of their lives. Once the
flight is ended, however, and the new locality
chosen, the wings disappear. Nature has no use
for needless things and from that time on the air
knows them no more. The carpenter ants get
busy right away. The place is marked off as accurately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as a surveyor marks out a plot in the
suburbs of a city. The queen ant is given a
royal room apart from all the others. She is a
good mother and takes the best of care of her
little ones. As they grow older, they in turn
help the queen to care for their little brothers
and sisters. They are excessively neat and clean
in their personal habits. They spend hours
preening and combing and cleaning until they are
immaculate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regular dudes,&rdquo; muttered Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s something that
will never be laid up against you, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim, who indeed had a hard time keeping up
to a high ideal of cleanliness, and whose hair was
usually tumbled while his nails too often were
draped in mourning, looked a little confused, and
while he was thinking up something to hurl back
at Tom, Dick went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing, however, about the ants
that I don&rsquo;t admire. They like to get somebody
else to do their work. A certain number of their
own colony are &lsquo;hewers of wood and drawers
of water&rsquo; for the rest. Indeed, the aristocrats
among them get so lazy after a while that they
will not even feed themselves. The workers
not only have to hustle for the grub, but actually
have to feed it to the lords and dukes. And talking
of hustling for grub, just look here.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys followed the direction of Dick&rsquo;s
finger, and there coming up a little beaten path
they saw a procession of ants dragging along a
big fat caterpillar. It had evidently put up a
good fight, judging from the numbers that had
been necessary to capture it, but they had proved
too strong. A little convulsive movement showed
that it was not yet quite dead, but it no longer
made any resistance. The formic acid that the
ants secrete had partly paralyzed it and made defence
impossible. There was an almost comical
disproportion between its large helpless bulk and
the tiny size of its conquerors, but this was a case
where numbers counted. The victors all pulled
like good fellows and passing through one of the
entrances of the mound finally dragged their booty
into the inner cave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; said Dick, when the keenly
interested boys had again gathered about him,
&ldquo;the red ants are slaveholders. When their
working force has been weakened or diminished,
they get a big army together and raid some colony
of black ants a few hundred feet or yards
distant in order to carry them away as slaves.
There is nothing haphazard or slouchy about the
way they go about it. Everything is arranged as
carefully and precisely as in the case of an American
or European power getting ready to go to
war. At a given signal the troops come out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and get in order of battle. There is perfect
order and system everywhere. When there is
a very large army, a sort of hum or buzz arises
from it almost as though they were beating
drums to inspire the soldiers for battle. They
march forward in perfect time and dash upon
the enemy with irresistible fury. The black ants
through their scouts have been told of the enemy&rsquo;s
approach and have made all the preparation
they can to beat them off. The infant ants,
together with their household goods, have been
tucked away in upper galleries where they can
see the fight but not be in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reserved seats as it were,&rdquo; murmured Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ants have two weapons. One is the nipper,
that can cut off their enemy&rsquo;s head as neatly
as a pair of shears. Then they have the formic
acid that, used against ants or other insects, has
a poisonous quality. With both of these weapons
they fight with the greatest desperation until
victory declares for one side or the other. The
red ants are usually victorious, as they are
larger and stronger and more aggressive. In
case they win, they carry away all the little ones
of their black opponents and bring them up as
slaves. They are treated kindly, and after a
while seem to grow content and take their place
as the humbler members of the community.
After the battle is over the wounded ants are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
carried home by their companions and the dead
are buried in a regular ants&rsquo; cemetery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys had listened with a fascinated interest
to these marvelous stories of life going on
all around them and to which they had never
given more than a passing thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;it sure is the queerest
thing I ever heard about. If anyone else but
Dick had told me this I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;it certainly sounds like a
fairy story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What gets me,&rdquo; said Shorty, &ldquo;is that the
queen seems to be the most important of the
whole bunch. What about the king? It must
be a regular suffragette colony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;in a certain sense it is.
The males of the community don&rsquo;t amount to
much. One by one their privileges are taken
away from them. They even lose their wings
before the females do. After they have taken
their flight and safely escorted the queen to her
future home they drop out of sight. Their
wings fall off and in some cases are pulled off
by the more ill-tempered females of the family.
They hang around a little while and then drop
out of sight altogether. Nobody seems to care
what becomes of them. They can&rsquo;t even get
back to the place from which they started.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Their wings are gone and they can&rsquo;t walk.
They remind me of the cat&mdash;they are so different&mdash;the
cat came back&mdash;the male ants can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;how do the rest get on
without them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t seem to
mind the males at all. It takes away some of
the conceit of the male sex when they see how
easily one can get along without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Shorty, who was never partial
to work, &ldquo;they at least get rid of a lot of
trouble. How about the carpenter ants, the
soldier ants, the foraging ants? Are they all
females?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one of them,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;It is a
regular colony of Amazons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Shorty, &ldquo;that in all
the bunch the queen is the only one who has a
snap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;as a
matter of fact, she is the hardest worker of all,
that is, at the start. She is the busiest kind of
a mother, brings up all the little ants, washing
their faces, combing their hair&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, say,&rdquo; interrupted Shorty, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you
putting it a little bit too strong, Dick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;here, take up this
ant and look at it through the magnifying glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the lens the boys, crowding around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
saw that there, sure enough, was a fine silky
down resembling very much the hair upon the
human head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;as in every other
part of the animal or insect world, this only
lasts for a little while. Men and women are
the only creatures in the whole universe that
stick by their children through thick and thin.
There is no better mother than a cat, for instance,
while the kittens are small and they need
her help, but just as soon as they are able to
shift for themselves, nothing more doing for
Mrs. Cat. Out they go to hustle for their own
living, and if some of the slower and lazier ones
still hang around, the mother&rsquo;s claws soon give
them a sharp reminder that it is time to be up
and doing. The same is true of the birds. See
how the mother bird sits brooding over her
eggs. With what tender care she watches them
while they are still unable to feed themselves.
How the father bird scratches from morning to
night to find worms to put down those scrawny
little beaks. But after a while they, too, go to
the edge of the nest, and with many a timid flutter
stretch their wings and drop off the edge.
And with the laggards, the parental beak is ready
to push them off into the new world where they
hustle for themselves. It is only a fellow&rsquo;s father
and mother that stand by him to the end. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
matter how bad he is, how often he wrenches
their hearts, how many times he has sinned and
been forgiven and sinned again, the mother heart
clings to him to the end. I tell you what, boys,
you can&rsquo;t make too much of that father and
mother of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; came in a responsive murmur from
the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, going back to the queen,&rdquo; said Dick,
&ldquo;it sure does seem that after the kids have grown
up she&rsquo;d have a dandy time. She is by far the
biggest figure in the colony. The worker ants
can&rsquo;t do too much for her. She has the finest
room and the choicest food, and yet, after all, I
suppose this becomes tiresome. It is just as it
is with human queens. So many things are done
for them, so much pomp and ceremony surrounds
them, that no doubt they often sigh for freedom
and would exchange their places with almost any
of their subjects. They are something like a little
girl that was a rich man&rsquo;s daughter. Her milk
was pasteurized, the water she drank was sterilized,
so that after a while her only thought was
to grow big enough to do as she chose and the
very first thing she was going to do was to eat
a germ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys laughed and Dick resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is almost pathetic to see the poor old
queen going out for a walk. She moves in a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
circle of courtiers. As long as she keeps in
the middle she is all right, but the minute she
strays to one side or attempts to go further, this
surrounding group push her back. Sometimes
they thrust their shoulders against her and at
other times simply mass themselves in front of
her, and even, at times, are undignified enough,
if these hints are not sufficient, to take her by one
of her antennae and lead her back into the center
of the circle, for all the world like a mother
taking home a naughty child by the ear. No,
you can bet it is not all &lsquo;peaches and cream&rsquo;
where the queen is concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Shorty, only partly convinced,
&ldquo;even if the queen has troubles of her own, it
must be nice to be the aristocrat. Think of having
nothing to do but just hang around and let
the carpenter ants build your house and the
farmer ants store up the grain and the foraging
ants bring in the caterpillars and the soldier ants
do the fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;you are wrong again,
Shorty. They do so little and become so dependent
upon the work of others that after a
while they seem to lose their faculties. They
wander around in a crazy and feeble way, trying
to kill time, I suppose, and after a while become
so lazy and helpless that they can&rsquo;t even eat
without help.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t eat!&rdquo; said Jim, whose appetite was a
standing joke in camp; &ldquo;then no lords and dukes
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really think,&rdquo; resumed Dick, &ldquo;that just as
it is in human life, the workers are the lucky
ones after all. There is something doing every
minute. Their lives are full of interest. They
are too busy to be unhappy. Don&rsquo;t make any
mistake, fellows, work is the salvation of the
world. The happiest are the busiest; the drones
and sluggards are almost, without exception, the
most miserable creatures on the face of the earth.
If I were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just at this moment a curious thing happened.
The afternoon had worn on while the
boys were talking, and so keen was their interest
in the wonders that were being brought before
their eyes that they had failed to realize how
late it was. The ants had been wandering around
in an aimless way&mdash;that is, it seemed aimless to
the boys, but doubtless they knew what they were
about and had a definite object, even though the
boys couldn&rsquo;t understand it. But now a sudden
stir and bustle seemed to arouse the colony.
From numerous gates the throng came forth with
almost military order and precision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s just the thing you
want to see, boys. It is milking time and the
ants are going to herd their cows. Now we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
follow one of these lines and see just how they
do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a few feet distant from the mound there
was a little shrub about three feet high, covered
with foliage and with widely extended branches.
The column of ants reached the foot of this,
climbed it, and scattered among the branches.</p>

<p>The boys at a signal from Dick followed him
softly, so that the ants might not be disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Dick, gently taking hold of a
branch that projected beyond the others, &ldquo;look
through this magnifying glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One by one the boys stole up, each eager for
a sight that they had never before seen or
dreamed of. On the upper side of the branch
which Dick held between his thumb and finger
were little groups of parasites, almost too small
to be seen by the naked eye. All day long they
had been feeding upon the sap that came from a
branch until their bodies were swollen with a
transparent honey dew. An ant approached one
of them, placed its antennae over the throat and
extracted a tiny drop of the colorless liquid.
Again and again this was repeated. It seemed
like rank robbery, but there was no resistance on
the part of the herd. They seemed just as glad
that milking time had come as do the cows that
stand lowing at the bars of the fence and calling
for the farmer. Drop after drop of the honey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
dew was extracted, until finally the aphid, as the
little creature is called, grew lank and thin, while
the ant became correspondingly large. From
time to time the antennae of the ant stroked the
tiny hair on the back, just as a farmer would
stroke the cow in order to soothe it and keep it
perfectly still.</p>

<p>Finally the milking was completed and the
farmer ants retraced their way along the branch
and down the stem and, falling into line with
their comrades similarly laden, resumed their
march to the colony. The boys had watched with
bated breath and almost awe-struck interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jim, at last breaking the silence,
&ldquo;those ants are surely not going hungry to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Shorty, &ldquo;I bet they will suffer
from indigestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose
they keep this all to themselves, do you?
Just look here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted a stone about eighteen inches from
the foot of the mound. Under the magnifying
glass they could see a number of tiny apertures
that evidently led in the direction of the colony,
and on one side an ant waiting for the return
of the milking party. As Dick selected one and
placed his magnifying glass directly upon the
opening, the boys could see one of the ants laden
with the honey dew stop and, placing its mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
close to that of the waiting ant, exude a tiny drop
of its burden. Moving the glass around quickly
in the arc of a circle, they saw this process repeated
until finally the round was finished and
the farmer ants, more lightly laden than before,
went on toward the main entrance of the colony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;are the lords and dukes
getting their supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;after this I am ready to
believe anything. I tell you what, Dick, I never
learned so much in my life as I have to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Shorty, as the boys picked up their
kits and prepared to return to camp, &ldquo;I am glad
enough now that I didn&rsquo;t smash that ant nest
when I tried to. After all, they are good sports
and I would hate to spoil their fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;you know that one of
the most important principles in life is kindness
to anything that breathes. Of course there are
certain pests that are harmful to human life and
we are compelled to kill in self-defense, but for
anything that is harmless the one great principle
that should govern us always is found in those
two lines that Mr. Hollis repeated the other
day:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Never to blend our pleasure or our pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sorrow to the meanest thing that feels.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Gipsy Caravan</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;Hello, fellows. Look at this. Well, of
all the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys looked up at Bob&rsquo;s startled exclamation,
and for a moment everything else was forgotten,
while they stared with wide-open eyes at
the grotesque procession that came into view.</p>

<p>Down the road crawled a little caravan of ten
or a dozen ramshackle wagons, drawn by tired-looking
horses. At their heads or alongside
walked a number of men of various ages, dressed
in all sorts of nondescript costumes. Their
swarthy faces and dark eyes, together with the
large earrings that they wore, gave them a distinctly
piratical appearance, and to the boys they
looked as though they might have been taken
bodily from one of the old romances of the Spanish
Main. They might easily have been the
blood brothers of the rascals who sang in thundering
chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fifteen men on the dead man&rsquo;s chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing heigho, and a bottle of rum.&rdquo;<br /></span></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>But, alas! there were no murderous pistols
thrust in their belts or cutlasses held between
their teeth to complete the illusion, and the picturesque
crowd resolved itself into a troop of
gipsies going into camp.</p>

<p>The place they had pitched upon for their temporary
stay was about three miles distant from
the boys&rsquo; camp and had been chosen with a keen
eye to its advantages. Either through a scout
sent ahead or simply by that marvelous sixth
sense so highly developed in wandering peoples,
they had elected to stop at a little ravine through
which ran a brook of sparkling water and surrounded
by a wood that furnished ample supplies
for their campfires. It was fascinating to see the
dexterity, born of long experience, with which the
camp was pitched. The horses were unhitched
in a twinkling and turned out to graze, while the
wagons were ranged in a single circle around the
camp. Some brown, dirty canvas and a few
branches of trees were quickly transformed into
tents. Wood was cut, a rough fireplace built, a
huge kettle suspended over the flames that crackled
merrily beneath, and the women and girls
who had descended from the wagons busied themselves
in bringing water from the brook and preparing
supper for the tired and hungry crew.
The men, after the rougher work was done,
sprawled around upon the grass, talking in a language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
unintelligible to the boys, and occasionally
casting an indifferent look at the group in the
automobile, who had watched the scene with
breathless interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert at last, as he roused himself
with an effort, &ldquo;they haven&rsquo;t asked us to stay to
supper, and I suppose it isn&rsquo;t good manners to
hang around while they are eating, even if this
is a public place. So here goes,&rdquo; and throwing
in the clutch he started the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; off toward
camp.</p>

<p>The liveliest interest, not unmixed with envy,
was shown by the other boys at the recital
by the auto squad of the afternoon&rsquo;s adventure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Jim Dawson, &ldquo;you fellows certainly
do have all the luck. If I&rsquo;d been with you
there&rsquo;d have been nothing more exciting than a
rabbit scurrying across the road. To-day I
stayed behind and here you fellows have watched
the pitching of a gipsy camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Jim,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all go
over soon and take it in. I suppose they&rsquo;ll be
there for some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling,&rdquo; remarked Dick. &ldquo;Sometimes
they stay in one place for two or three
weeks, until the call of the road becomes so
strong that they can&rsquo;t resist it. Then again, after
a day or two, they</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Fold their tents like the Arabs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silently steal away.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Steal&rsquo; is a very good word to use in that
connection, Dick,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis, as he joined
the group, when after an abundant supper they
sat around the campfire; &ldquo;for if what we hear
of gipsies in general is true, they spend most of
their time in stealing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, though,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that is putting
it a little too harshly. There is a strong
prejudice against them because of their vagrant
mode of life, and there is no doubt that the distinction
between &lsquo;mine&rsquo; and &lsquo;thine&rsquo; is very vague
in their minds. Hen-roosts are apt to be mysteriously
thinned out when they are in the neighborhood,
and many a porker has uttered his last
squeal when gripped by a gipsy hand. Horses,
too, occasionally vanish in a way that would mean
a short shrift and a rope in the Western country,
if the thief were caught. But, on the other hand,
they seldom commit deeds of violence. You
never hear of their blowing open a safe, and,
though they are passionate and hot tempered,
they are not often charged with murder. The
Bowery thug and yeggman are much more dangerous
enemies to society than the average gipsy.
Perhaps the worst indictment to be brought
against them is that in years past they were frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
guilty of kidnapping. But that was in
the earlier days, when the country was sparsely
settled and communication was difficult. Then, if
they got a good start, it was often impossible to
overtake them. But to-day, with the country
thickly populated and the telegraph and telephone
everywhere, they would most certainly be caught.
No doubt the elders of the tribe shake their heads
sadly as they reflect that the kidnapping industry
is no longer what it has been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do they make a living, anyway?&rdquo; interjected
Dave. &ldquo;What they steal isn&rsquo;t enough to
keep them alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Mr. Hollis, &ldquo;the men are
very keen traders in horses. They know a horse
from mane to hoof. They can take a poor old
wreck of a cart horse and doctor him up until he
looks and acts like a thoroughbred. Very few
men can get ahead of them in a trade, as many
a farmer has found to his cost. The women are
often very expert in embroidery and find a ready
sale for their really beautiful work. Then, too,
as fortune tellers they are proverbial the world
over. Cross a gipsy&rsquo;s palm with gold or silver
and she&rsquo;ll predict for you a future that kings and
queens might envy. It is safe to say that during
their stay here they will reap quite a harvest&mdash;enough
at least to suffice for the simple needs of
to-day. As for to-morrow, they don&rsquo;t care. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
can take care of itself. They are as irresponsible
as crickets or butterflies. They &lsquo;never trouble
trouble till trouble troubles them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dave, &ldquo;they get rid of a whole
lot of needless worry, anyway. They don&rsquo;t suffer
as much as the old lady did who said that
she had had an awful lot of trouble in her life
and most of it had never happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys laughed, and Tom asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do they get their name from? Why
do they call them gipsies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Mr. Hollis, &ldquo;they were
supposed to be descended from the old Egyptians.
They resemble them in features, and many
words in their language are derived from Egypt.
Many scholars think, however, that their original
home was India. Europe has been familiar
with them for the last four hundred years. They
have always been Ishmaelites&mdash;their hand against
every man and every man&rsquo;s hand against them&mdash;and
by some they have been believed to be the
actual descendants of Ishmael, the outcast son of
Abraham. Everywhere they have been despised
and persecuted. In the old days they were accused
of being sorcerers and witches. They have
been banished, burned at the stake, broken on the
wheel, hung, drawn and quartered. It is one of
the miracles of history that they have not been
wiped out altogether. But they have always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
clung closely together and persisted in their
strange, wandering way of life. They have a
language of their own and certain rude laws that
all the tribes acknowledge. The restless instinct
is in their blood and probably will be there forever.
They are a living protest against civilization
as we understand it. Occasionally, one of
them will join the ranks of ordinary men, but, far
more frequently, they gain recruits from those
who want to throw off the shackles and conventions
of the settled life. More than one man
and woman have listened to the &lsquo;call of the wild&rsquo;
and followed the gipsies, as the children in the
fable followed the Pied Piper of Hamelin. But
now, boys,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time for &lsquo;taps.&rsquo;
To-morrow evening we&rsquo;ll all go over and take a
closer look at these gipsies of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All through the following day the boys, though
attentive to what they were doing, were keenly
alive to the promised treat that night. There
was an early supper, to which, despite the under-current
of excitement, they did full justice, and
then in the gathering dusk the boys set out for
the grove. Since not all could go in the automobile,
it was decided that all should go on foot,
and with jest and laughter they covered the three
miles almost before they knew it.</p>

<p>Quite different from that of the day before
was the sight that burst upon them as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
rounded a curve in the road and came upon the
picturesque vagrants. Here and there were
torches of pitch pine that threw a smoky splendor
over the scene and hid all the squalor and sordid
poverty that had been so evident in the broad
light of day. By this time it was fully dark, but
a full moon cast its beauty over the trees and
flecked the ground with bright patches that added
to the torches made the whole grove like a fairyland.
The news of the gipsies&rsquo; coming had
reached the surrounding towns, and there was
quite a gathering of pretty girls and country
swains, whose buggies stood under the trees at
the roadside, while youths and maidens wandered
among the wagons of the caravan. At the open
door of one of the vans a young gipsy drew from
a violin the weird, heart-tugging strains that have
made their music famous throughout the world.
Others sat around their fire and talked together
in a low tone, casting furtive glances at the visitors,
whose coming they seemed neither to welcome
nor resent. With their instinctive appreciation
of the fine points in any animal, the eyes of
some of them brightened as Don threaded his
way through the different groups, but, apart from
that, they gave no sign that they were conscious
of the newcomers.</p>

<p>With the gipsy women, however, it was different.
This was their hour and they improved it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to the utmost. Withered crones and handsome
girls with curious turbans wound about their
heads went from group to group, offering to tell
their fortunes, provided their palms were crossed.
There was no difficulty about this, as most of the
girls had come there with that one desire and the
gallant youths who escorted them urged them to
gratify it regardless of expense. If the recording
angel put down that night all the lies that
were told, all the promises of wealth and title
and position that sent many a giddy head awhirl
to its pillow, he was kept exceedingly busy. Just
for a lark, the boys themselves were willing patrons
of these priestesses of the future; but little
of what was promised them remained in their
memory, except that Tom was to meet a &ldquo;dark
lady&rdquo; who was to have a great and happy influence
upon his life. The boys chaffed him a good
deal about this mystical brunette, but he maintained
with mock gravity that &ldquo;one never
knows&rdquo; and that perhaps the swarthy soothsayer
&ldquo;knew what she was talking about after
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In view of the unusual circumstances, Mr. Hollis
had not insisted upon the ordinary rules, and
it was nearly midnight when the boys, having
trudged back to camp, prepared to retire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is it, anyway, Dick?&rdquo; yawned
Bert, as they started to undress.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Dick, as he reached for his
watch; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped aghast as the chain came out of
his pocket with a jerk. His watch was gone.</p>

<p>At this instant a shout came from Bob Ward&rsquo;s
tent: &ldquo;Say, fellows, have any of you seen my
scarfpin? I can&rsquo;t find it anywhere. I&rsquo;m sure I
had it on when I started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert looked at Dick and Dick stared back at
Bert. The same thought came into their minds
at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stung,&rdquo; groaned Dick, as he sank down
heavily on his bed.</p>

<p>At once the camp was in commotion. Everyone
made a hasty inventory of his belongings
and the relief was general when it was found
that nothing else was missing. Their hearts were
hot with indignation, however, at the loss of their
comrades. Dick&rsquo;s gold watch had been a graduation
present and Bob&rsquo;s scarfpin had held a handsome
stone, so that the money loss was considerable.
But deeper yet was the sense of chagrin
voiced by Jim Dawson:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, disgustedly, &ldquo;if this isn&rsquo;t the
limit. Here we are, city fellows who think we
are up to snuff. We are surrounded by pickpockets
every day and nothing happens. Then
we come out in the country and are roasted brown
by a band of wandering gipsies.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Mr. Hollis, aroused by the unusual
stir, had hastily dressed and joined the excited
group. The facts were quickly detailed to
him, and, as he listened, his face set in hard
lines that boded ill for the thieves. He first directed
that a thorough search be made in order
to be perfectly sure that the missing articles were
not somewhere about the camp. When careful
examination failed to reveal them, doubt became
certainty. If only one thing had been lost it
might have been set down to carelessness or accident,
but that two should disappear at the same
time pointed to but one explanation&mdash;theft. And
it was a foregone conclusion that the thieves were
to be found in the gipsy camp.</p>

<p>The more hot-headed were for starting out at
once to regain the watch and pin at any cost.
But this was vetoed by Mr. Hollis, who recognized
the futility of attempting anything at so
late an hour. He promised that early in the
morning they should all go together, and with
that promise they were forced to be content.</p>

<p>There was very little sleep for the boys that
night, and at the first streak of dawn the whole
camp was astir. Breakfast was swallowed hastily,
and Bert whistled for Don as the boys made
ready to start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Don, old fellow, good dog,&rdquo; he called
when the whistle failed to bring him; but no Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
appeared. Then a thought suddenly struck Bert.
When had he last seen the collie? In the excitement
last night he and the other boys had given
no thought to the dog. He recalled with a sudden
sick feeling that he had last seen him in the
light of the gipsy torches. His heart smote him
for his forgetfulness. Was it possible that the
gipsies had stolen Don also? Why not? He
never would have stayed away of his own accord.
The collie was a splendid animal of the purest
breed and would easily bring a large price if offered
for sale anywhere. A fierce rage flamed in
Bert&mdash;a rage shared by all the others when he
hastily told them of the suspicion that every
moment was becoming a conviction&mdash;and it was
lucky for the abductor of Don that he did not
at that moment meet Bert Wilson face to face.</p>

<p>With Dick, Tom and Bob, he leaped into the
&ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; and taking up Mr. Hollis as they
came to the door of his tent, they swung into the
broad high road, leaving the others to follow as
fast as they could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, purr, old Scout,&rdquo; said Bert as he threw
in the clutch; and the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; purred. It
leaped forward like a living thing, as though it
pulsed with the indignation and determination of
its riders. They fairly ate up the three miles in
as many minutes, turned the curve of the road
just this side of the gipsy camp and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The camp was gone!</p>

<p>Gone as though it had dropped into the earth.
Gone as though it had melted into the air. Utterly
and completely gone. The ashes of last
night&rsquo;s fires, some litter scattered here and there,
alone remained to mark the spot that a few hours
before had been so full of life and animation.</p>

<p>They leaped from the car and scattered everywhere
looking for signs to indicate the direction
the caravan had taken. They had certainly not
come south by the boys&rsquo; camp. It was equally
certain that they had not gone directly north, as
this led straight to a large town that they would
instinctively avoid. This narrowed the search to
east and west roads, from which, however, many
byroads diverged, so that it left them utterly at
sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The telephone,&rdquo; cried Bert; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s try that
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They bundled into the car and a few minutes
brought them to the nearest town. Picking out
half a dozen addresses along different roads, they
called them up. Had they seen a band of gipsies
going by? The answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; came with exasperating
monotony, until suddenly Bert leaped to
his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are, boys,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Bartlett on
the Ashby road, eight miles from here, saw them
go by two hours ago. Now let&rsquo;s get busy.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>They flew down the Ashby road and in a few
minutes came to the Bartlett farm. Yes, they had
passed there and they certainly were traveling
some. A couple of miles further on the road
forked. There was a negro cabin at that place
and they might get some information there. He
hoped so, anyway. Good luck, and with a word
of thanks, the boys rushed on.</p>

<p>A stout negress washing clothes under the tree
at the fork of the road wiped the suds from her
hands with her apron as she came forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey sholy did go pass hyar, gemmun, and
dey wuz drivin&rsquo; as do de ole Nick was affer dem.
Dat&rsquo;s a pow&rsquo;ful po&rsquo; road up dataway and der
hosses wuz plum tired. Dey kain&rsquo;t be ve&rsquo;y far
ahaid, I specs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Exultingly Bert threw in the high speed. Their
quarry had been run down at last. The motor
fairly sang as they plunged up the road. Turning
a curve to the right they came upon the procession
of carts, now toiling along painfully. Bert
never hesitated a second, but rushed past the line
of wagons until he had reached the head of the
caravan. <a href="#image03">Then he swung the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; squarely
across the road</a> and with Mr. Hollis, Dick, Tom
and Bob, sprang to the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<a name="image03" id="image03"><img src="images/image03.jpg" width="382" height="600" alt="Then he swung the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; squarely across the road." title="Then he swung the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; squarely across the road." /></a>
<br /><span class="caption"><a href="#Page_89">Then he swung the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; squarely across the road.</a>&mdash;(<i>See page 89</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>Consternation plainly reigned in the halted
carts. The men crowded forward and hastily
consulted. A moment later an old man, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the chief, came forward. He was prepared to
try diplomacy first, and with an ingratiating smile
held out his hand to Mr. Hollis. The latter,
ignoring the extended hand, came straight to the
point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want three things,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and unless
you are looking for trouble, you&rsquo;ll hand them
over at once. I want the pin and watch and dog
your people stole from us last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leader&rsquo;s smile faded, to be replaced by
an ominous scowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he said sullenly, &ldquo;my people stole
nothing. Get out of our road,&rdquo; he snarled viciously,
while his followers gathered threateningly
around him.</p>

<p>The air was surcharged with danger and a
fight seemed imminent, when suddenly a familiar
bark came from one of the vans. Bert dashed
forward, thrusting aside a young gipsy who
sprang to intercept him. He threw open the van
door, and out rushed Don, mad with delight.
He had chewed in half the rope that held him
and the frayed remnant hung about his neck as
he leaped on Bert and capered frantically about
him.</p>

<p>The game was up! Fear and chagrin were
painted on the gipsies&rsquo; faces. They might have
bluffed through as regards the stolen articles and
it would have been almost impossible to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
their guilt. But here was the living proof of
theft&mdash;proof strong enough to land their party
behind the bars. Moreover, the great dog was
no mean addition to the little force that faced
them so undauntedly. It was plainly up to them
to temporize. As Bob with regrettable slanginess,
but crisp brevity, summed up the case:
&ldquo;They had thought to make a quick touch and
getaway, but fell down doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chief held up his hand. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;while I talk to my people. Perhaps they have
found something. I will see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A whispered conversation followed and then
he came forward sheepishly, holding out the
watch and pin. &ldquo;They found them on the
grounds. I did not know,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis took them without a word and
motioned Bert to get the auto ready. He had
gained his point and did not care to press his
advantage further. After all, they were almost
like irresponsible children, and, despite his resentment,
he felt a deep pity for these half-wild
sons of poverty and misfortune. Their code was
not his code, nor their laws his laws. They were
the &ldquo;under dogs&rdquo; in the fight of life. Let them
go.</p>

<p>The motor began to hum. The party piled in,
with Don between them, barking joyfully, and
they swept down the shabby line of carts with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
not a glance behind them. They waved gaily to
the old black mammy, who beamed upon them as
they went by. A thought struck Bert, and turning
to Tom, he shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dark lady, Tom. The dark lady that
the gipsy prophesied would bring you luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; grinned Tom. &ldquo;It certainly is
luck enough to get old Don back, to say nothing
of the watch and pin. Isn&rsquo;t it, old fellow?&rdquo; and
he patted the dog&rsquo;s head lovingly.</p>

<p>So thought the rest of the boys, also, when the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; reached camp. Don was overwhelmed
with caresses and strutted about as though he had
done it all. As Jim put it: &ldquo;Napoleon on his
return from Elba had nothing on Don.&rdquo; It was
late when the excitement subsided and the campers
went weary but happy to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis, Bert and Dick lingered about the
fire. Only these older ones had realized how
ticklish a situation they had faced that day.
They didn&rsquo;t like to think what might have happened
if it had come to an open fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way you faced that crowd was the pluckiest
thing I ever saw, Mr. Hollis,&rdquo; said Bert;
&ldquo;but suppose it had come to a showdown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Hollis, &ldquo;it was a case
of touch and go for a minute. But I counted on
the fact that we were right and they were wrong.
&lsquo;Conscience makes cowards of us all.&rsquo; Behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
us were law and order and civilization. Behind
them crowded nameless shapes of fear and dread
that robbed their arms of strength and turned
their hearts to water. It was simply a confirmation,&rdquo;
he concluded, as he rose to say good night,
&ldquo;of the eternal truth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span></div></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">How the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; Climbed Dobb&rsquo;s Hill</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The morning of the long anticipated day in
the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; dawned bright and clear,
and the campers who were to go were astir soon
after dawn. Most of them would willingly have
dispensed with breakfast, but Mr. Hollis insisted
that they take their time and eat a hearty
meal. However, everything comes to him who
waits, and at last they were ready to start. It
had been arranged that on their trip they were
to stop in town, and get supplies and some camp
appliances that Mr. Hollis required. Otherwise
they were to do as they pleased, subject only to
Bert&rsquo;s authority.</p>

<p>The car was ready to start, and Bert had received
Mr. Hollis&rsquo; last instructions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, fellows,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;pile in, and we&rsquo;ll
start for town right away. It rather looks now
as though we might have a little rain before the
day is over. I don&rsquo;t like the looks of the sky
over there any too much, but we&rsquo;ve got to have
grub anyway, even if we have to go after it in
boats.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, or we might swim, I suppose,&rdquo; suggested
Shorty, sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, we&rsquo;d let you try it, as its only
a matter of twenty miles or so each way, and see
if you are as strong as your name,&rdquo; retorted Bert,
and Shorty subsided.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the others had taken their appointed
places in the auto, and, after adjusting
spark and throttle levers, Bert walked to the front
of the machine and cranked the motor.</p>

<p>On the first turn, such was the beautiful condition
in which he kept the car, the engine started
with a roar, and he quickly climbed into the driver&rsquo;s
seat and threw in the clutch. Without a
tremor the big car glided away as if moving on
air, which indeed it was, in a way, if the air in
the tires could be counted.</p>

<p>With the ease of a driver who thoroughly understands
his car, Bert steered the machine
around and between the bumps in the road, and
even one who had never ridden in an automobile
before would have appreciated his masterly
handling of this machine.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom, who, as usual, was riding in
the seat beside Bert, leaned over and said, &ldquo;Say,
Bert, do you suppose she would take Dobb&rsquo;s
hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, the hill to which Tom referred was one
notorious in the neighborhood. More than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
gray-haired farmer had shaken his head dubiously
while inspecting the &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; and said,
&ldquo;Yes, that there contraption may be all right on
the level, and there&rsquo;s no getting over the fact
that it can run circles around a streak of greased
lightning, but I&rsquo;ll bet a dollar to a doughnut
that it could never get up Dobb&rsquo;s hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Bert thought a moment before answering
Tom&rsquo;s question, and then said, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s an
awfully steep hill, but the old &lsquo;Scout&rsquo; has never
balked at anything yet, and I have a sneaking
feeling that it wouldn&rsquo;t even stop at Dobb&rsquo;s hill.
However, there is only one way of finding out
about it, and that is to try it. What do you say,
fellows, shall we try it and show these people
around here just what our machine can
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a unanimous chorus of assent from
the other occupants of the car, so at the next
crossing Bert turned off the main road in the direction
of the famous Dobb&rsquo;s hill. Soon the hill
itself loomed up in front of them, and Bert
opened the throttle a trifle. The machine immediately
picked up speed, but to the occupants of
the machine it seemed almost impossible that
anything but an elevator could get up that hill.
It looked to them almost like a high wall. Bert,
however, was thinking more of the machine than
of the hill. He had been gradually giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
engine more gas, and now, when they were almost
at the foot of the hill, he realized that the
moment had come to call forth the supreme effort
of the motor. He opened the muffler so as
to get rid of all back pressure, and opened the
throttle to its widest extent. With a bound and
a roar the powerful machine took the hill, and to
the boys in the car it seemed as though they had
some powerful, willing animal working for them.
Up the great machine climbed, with scarcely diminished
speed, the engine emitting unbroken
and exhilarating music, or at least that is what
it sounded like to the tense boys in the auto. At
last with a final roar of the motor, and rumble
of the straining gears, the machine topped the
hill and started on its long downward coast.
Bert threw out the clutch, and giving the engine
a well-earned rest after its strenuous work, allowed
the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; to glide rapidly and
smoothly down the hill.</p>

<p>Every boy in the car seemed half-crazy with
delight over the performance of their mechanical
pet. Some even went so far as to pat the
sides of the car, and Bob expressed the general
feeling when he said, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d rather be a
camper and be able to say I held part ownership
in a car like this, than to be King of England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys also realized that a lot of credit was
due Bert for the success of their climb, as even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
such a car as the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; could never have
gotten up that hill without expert handling.</p>

<p>Down the long hill glided the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo;
with constantly increasing momentum, and long
before they reached the bottom Bert had to apply
the powerful brakes with which the machine
was equipped, and check its speed.</p>

<p>Gradually he slowed it down to a safer, but
less exciting speed, and at the bottom eased in
the clutch and the willing motor took up the
load.</p>

<p>In the meantime the sky had taken on a more
threatening appearance, and while the happy-go-lucky
boys in the tonneau gave it little thought,
Bert, to whom the care of the car and its occupants
were intrusted, cast more than one dubious
and anxious glance in the direction in which the
storm might be expected to break. He hoped
that they might at least make the necessary trip
to town and back before the rain could catch
them, however, and so held a steady pace, and
they were soon rolling down the main street.</p>

<p>Bert got out his list of the things they would
need, and detailed the boys to different stores so
that they could get started again as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s last remark to them was, &ldquo;Now, fellows,
step just as lively as you know how, and
whatever else you do, don&rsquo;t come back drunk.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
This raised a general laugh, as, it is needless to
say, the boys had had no such intentions.</p>

<p>Bert and Tom remained with the car, and
while Bert said less than the other boys about
his love for the machine, it was easy to see that
he had a real affection for it, and took pleasure
in cleaning and adjusting it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Tom,&rdquo; he called after a few minutes,
&ldquo;bring me grandfather, will you?&rdquo; Now,
&ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; was not what that word usually
means, but an immense monkey-wrench, with
jaws on it like a vise. It was called grandfather
for no particular reason that anybody knew of,
but someone had called it that once, and the name
had stuck. The boys sometimes used it to exercise
and perform feats of strength with, so heavy
was it. So now, when Tom got it out of the tool
box on the running board and handled it with
loving care, Bert took it from him, and for several
minutes was busy adjusting and tightening
bolts and nuts around the motor and transmission
case. Finally he handed the wrench back to
Tom with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good job
well done. I&rsquo;ll bet we could take that hill now
even a little better than we did, if that&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; replied Tom, &ldquo;this
old Scout went up that hill better than I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
it could, and I guess you ought to have as much
credit as the machine. After this I will back
you and the &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; against all comers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this it may be seen that there was more
than a little hero worship mingled with Tom&rsquo;s
love for Bert, and no wonder. Bert was the
sort of fellow that everyone had to admire and
like.</p>

<p>By this time the boys had begun to return with
their bundles and boxes, and soon everything was
safely stored in the tonneau, and the boys had
time to wonder how they were going to get themselves
in too, as the supplies seemed to take up
about all the room.</p>

<p>Finally it was arranged that Jim and Dave
should stay in the tonneau to see that nothing
was shaken overboard, while Bob and Frank
ranged themselves on the running board.</p>

<p>In this fashion they started, but it soon became
evident to everybody that they would never be
able to get back to camp before the storm broke,
even with the help of the &ldquo;Red Scout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thunder could be heard coming nearer and
nearer, and soon they felt the first warm drops
of rain. Bert wished then that they had a top
to their car, but unfortunately the leather covering
ordered by Mr. Hollis had not yet arrived
at the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think we&rsquo;d better do, Bert;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
make a run for camp or hunt shelter around
here?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, this road is pretty rough, and we can&rsquo;t
make much speed,&rdquo; replied Bert. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d
better hunt cover right away,&rdquo; as a vivid streak
of lightning split the sky, followed by a crash of
thunder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We noticed an old barn over toward the
right when we were on a botany expedition the
other day,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and I think that if you
swing into that dirt road we&rsquo;re coming to, it will
lead us right to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; said Bert, and swung the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; into the old road. Sure enough,
before they had gone a quarter of a mile they
sighted the old barn, and were soon snugly established
in it. To be sure, the roof leaked in
places, but it was fairly tight, and what did a
bunch of hardy campers, in the pink of condition,
care for a few drops of rain?</p>

<p>There was some hay left in the barn, and they
lounged comfortably around on this, talking and
listening to the rain, which by this time had increased
to a downpour, and beat fiercely on the
roof and sides of the old barn.</p>

<p>The boys started a discussion about the hill-climbing
feat of the &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; and while all
agreed that it had been a splendid performance,
Bob seemed to be inclined to sneer at Bert&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
handling of the car. He firmly believed that he
knew more about automobiles than Bert, and
was sometimes a little jealous of the praise given
him by the other boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he finally remarked,
when Tom remarked that some people seemed
able to coax more out of a car than others, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see that that makes much difference. I&rsquo;ll
bet that if I had been running the &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo;
this morning it would have gone up that hill just
the same. Why, when I used to run my uncle&rsquo;s
car&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but here he was interrupted by cries of
derision, and Tom remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that if Bob had been running the
&lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; he would have run it up the hill
backwards so that it would think it was going
downhill, and so got to the top without any
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sally caused a general laugh at Bob&rsquo;s expense
and he subsided, but was heard to mutter
about &ldquo;getting the right mixture,&rdquo; and &ldquo;easing
her down to second speed,&rdquo; which nobody but
Bert understood, but which seemed to make him
feel much better.</p>

<p>In justice to Bob, it must be said, however, that
he did know quite a little about automobiles, but
usually lacked nerve when it came to putting his
knowledge into practice.</p>

<p>By this time the boys were all hungry, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
there seemed to be a small chance of the rain
letting up for a while, Bert proposed that they
have lunch. There was plenty of food in the
automobile, and Bert started the boys to fishing
out crackers and jam.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck him. &ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo;
he called, &ldquo;how about making some cornbread
and having a real bang-up meal? We&rsquo;ve
got bacon and all the fixings here, and we all
know how to cook, thanks to our experience as
campers. I&rsquo;ll make the corn bread, and Tom
here will fry the bacon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was such a joyous and noisy consent to
this plan that Bert could not help laughing. &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;some of you fellows dive into
the car and bring out the new frying pan and the
Dutch oven we bought to-day. We&rsquo;ll build a
fire on that slab of stone over there, and have
something to eat in next to no time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was no sooner said than done, and as
the odor of frying bacon and hot &ldquo;corn pone&rdquo;
filled the old barn, the boys thanked their lucky
stars for the thousandth time that they had come
on this camping trip.</p>

<p>In a short time everything was ready, and they
seated themselves near the fire. Tom dished out
the sizzling bacon and steaming &ldquo;corn pone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the cheering influence of this feast even
Bob Ward forgot his grudge of the morning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
when he shouted, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Wilson?&rdquo;
the resulting &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; almost
lifted the roof off the old barn.</p>

<p>Soon they had finished and cleared away the
meal, and when they opened the barn door were
surprised and delighted to find that the sun had
struggled through the clouds and was now shining
brightly. Quickly they packed the tonneau,
and were soon ready to start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, fellows, get to your places,&rdquo; sang
out Bert, and soon they were chugging out of
the old barn that had offered them such timely
shelter.</p>

<p>Once outside and fairly on the disused road,
however, it soon became apparent that only with
great difficulty could they make any progress at
all. The rain had converted the road into a
quagmire, and although Bert brought the &ldquo;Red
Scout&rdquo; from third speed to second, and finally
to first, he saw that they must soon stop altogether,
and indeed this soon proved to be the
case.</p>

<p>The faithful motor apparently had plenty of
power, but the car sank into the mud up to its
axles, and the rear wheels simply turned around
without propelling it. Bert finally threw out the
clutch and the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; stopped as though
he had applied the brakes, so great was the opposition
formed by the mud.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a pretty fix, to be sure,&rdquo; exclaimed
Bert. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have the time
of our lives getting this machine out. What you
need for this road is not so much an automobile
as a boat. However, it wouldn&rsquo;t speak well for
us if we couldn&rsquo;t get our car out of this scrape
after all it has done for us, so let&rsquo;s get busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;but the
question is, how are you going to do it? This
isn&rsquo;t exactly a flying machine, although it can go
pretty fast, and it seems to me that we will need
something like that to get us out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Jim Dawson,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, indignantly,
&ldquo;here you call yourself one of the crowd, and
yet you are willing to give up before you have
fairly begun to try. That isn&rsquo;t the right spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy enough to talk,&rdquo; answered Jim,
sulkily, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d just like to know how you are
going to do it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say I have a plan right now,
but I&rsquo;m sure that our old &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t going
to leave us in the lurch now after all it has done
so far,&rdquo; and here he patted the vibrating car lovingly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bert had been thinking deeply, and
had finally hit on a plan. &ldquo;Here, some of you
fellows, run back and bring me all the hay you
can carry from that barn, will you? We want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to get out of here as soon as we can, because Mr.
Hollis will be anxious about us. Lively&rsquo;s the
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom, Bob, and Frank ran back to the barn
and soon reappeared, carrying armfuls of hay.
When they reached the car Bert took charge of
it, and placed it carefully under the rear wheels,
and made a path in front of each wheel for about
six feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can only get over to the side of the
road and up on that grass there,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;we will be on firmer ground and can get better
traction. I only wish we had tire chains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are tire chains, Bert, and what are
they for?&rdquo; inquired Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see how it is,&rdquo; replied Bert, &ldquo;we
have plenty of power, but the wheels can&rsquo;t get
a grip on the ground, and just skid around. If
we had a network of chains over the tires they
would bite through the mud to solid ground and
get the grip we need. Understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, and much obliged for the explanation,&rdquo;
said Frank, heartily.</p>

<p>By this time Bert had arranged things to his
satisfaction, and now climbed into the driver&rsquo;s
seat, while the boys looked on expectantly.</p>

<p>Bert threw out the clutch, advanced the spark
slightly, and opened the throttle a few notches.
Immediately the motor increased its revolutions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and when it had reached a good speed Bert gently
eased in the clutch. There was a grinding sound
of clutch and gears as the power was transmitted
to the rear wheels, and the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; lunged
forward.</p>

<p>The front wheels were so firmly embedded by
this time, however, that even the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo;
was helpless. Again and again Bert raced his
engine and let in the clutch, and each time the
machine made a gallant attempt to free itself,
but could never quite make it. Finally he reversed,
but with no better result. At last he
gave up the attempt, and leaving the motor turning
over slowly, descended to hold a consultation
with the other boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any suggestions to make, fellows?&rdquo;
he asked, &ldquo;I confess I&rsquo;m up a tree just
at present. What do you say, Bob? Can you
think of anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I was thinking,&rdquo; answered Bob, flattered
by this direct appeal to his vaunted experience,
&ldquo;that if we could dig out a path in front
of the machine up onto the grass we might get
it out that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! you&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head this
time!&rdquo; exclaimed Bert, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;ll do. Get that spade out
of the tonneau, will you Frank, and we&rsquo;ll get to
work.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank immediately complied, and in an incredibly
short space of time the boys had a path
dug in front of the auto down to hard gravel,
and were ready for another attempt to extricate
their beloved car.</p>

<p>Bert climbed into his seat with a do-or-die expression
on his handsome young face, and repeated
his former tactics, but this time with
greater success. The &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; surged forward
with a roar, like some imprisoned wild
creature suddenly given its liberty. Bert took no
chances this time, but plugged steadily onward
until he reached high, firm ground. Here he
stopped the panting machine, and waited for the
cheering boys to catch up.</p>

<p>They soon reached the faithful car, and quickly
jumped into their places. Before starting again
Bert turned around and said, &ldquo;Fellows, I think
we owe Bob a vote of thanks. All who agree
please say &lsquo;Aye&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hearty chorus of &ldquo;Ayes,&rdquo; and
Bob flushed with pleasure at this tribute from
his comrades. He thought, and with reason,
that he had demonstrated his knowledge of automobiles
to good advantage, as well as his ability
to meet emergencies.</p>

<p>By this time it was getting near dusk, and Bert
knew that Mr. Hollis would be worried over
their continued absence. Accordingly, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
got on to the main road, he threw the gears into
high speed, and soon they were bowling along
at a rapid, but safe, pace toward their camp.</p>

<p>It would be hard to imagine a happier set of
boys in the world than those who sat in the big
red automobile in the silence of good fellowship
and listened to the contented purring of the &ldquo;Red
Scout&rsquo;s&rdquo; powerful motor.</p>

<p>As they revolved in their minds the exciting
occurrences of the day, and thought of other
equally happy days yet to come, it seemed to
them that there was indeed nothing more desirable
in life than to be campers with such leaders
as Mr. Hollis, Bert Wilson, and Dick Trent. It
is safe to say that they would not have changed
places with any other set of boys on earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Bert,&rdquo; said Jim Dawson, breaking the
long silence, &ldquo;that race is as good as won already.
I&rsquo;m sure that with this machine and you
driving it, we couldn&rsquo;t lose if we tried. What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert did not answer for a moment, and when
he did his eyes twinkled merrily. &ldquo;Well, Jim,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether we&rsquo;ll win or not
and that &lsquo;Gray Ghost&rsquo; is certainly some racer.
From what I have seen of our old &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; to-day,
however,&mdash;but there, I&rsquo;m not going to say
any more just now. There is no use raising
your hopes, and then perhaps have nothing come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of that in the end.&rdquo; And with that they were
forced to be content.</p>

<p>By this time they had almost reached the
camp, and could see the smoke of the fire. Soon
they rolled smoothly into camp, and Mr. Hollis
came to meet them with a relieved look on his
face. At first he seemed inclined to blame them,
but Bert soon explained matters to his entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>The boys mingled with their comrades, and
many were the exclamations of wonder over their
day&rsquo;s experiences. After a short rest, supper was
prepared, and while they all voted it delicious,
still they claimed that nothing had ever tasted
quite as good as their lunch in the old barn.</p>

<p>As Tom and Bert were dropping off to sleep
that night, Tom murmured drowsily, &ldquo;Say, Bert,
did we or didn&rsquo;t we have a bully time to-day,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just bet your hat we did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, say, isn&rsquo;t the old &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; about
the greatest automobile that ever turned a
wheel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s whatever it is,&rdquo; concurred Bert, and
dropped off to sleep with a smile on his face, and
the image of a big red automobile enthroned in
his heart.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Quick Work</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;You fellows get it all,&rdquo; complained Steve
Thomas, with as ugly a look as such a
round good-natured face as his could wear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sure do seem to move in a charmed circle,&rdquo;
chimed in another grumbler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; echoed a third. &ldquo;They ought
to be called the lucky three. This is the fourth
time in less than two weeks that they&rsquo;ve had the
auto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;lucky three,&rdquo; to whom these remarks
were addressed, stood grinning happily at the
disgusted faces of the other fellows in camp.</p>

<p>The question to be settled was as to what ones
should take the auto into town for some supplies
that were unexpectedly but urgently needed.
There had been quite a lively dispute, waxing
louder and louder until it threatened to end in
a genuine quarrel.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis, busily finishing some letters that
he wanted to send into town by the boys, was at
first too absorbed in his writing to notice the unusual
disturbance, but as the recriminations grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
hotter he saw that immediate action was necessary.</p>

<p>Rising hastily and taking in his hand a sheet
of paper on which he had been writing, he stepped
from his tent into the group of heated boys.</p>

<p>The clamor ceased at once and when he learned
the cause of the discussion, Mr. Hollis proposed
to draw lots. The fellows who should draw the
numbers one, two and three were to be the autoists
for the trip.</p>

<p>This seemed fair to all, and cutting the paper
into equal strips Mr. Hollis wrote a number on
each and, shaking them well in a hat passed them
around. When they had all been drawn, each
one turned over his slip and looked eagerly for
the sign that fate had been good to him.</p>

<p>The lot had fallen to Bert, Tom, and Ben.
There was no appeal and the rest of the camp
had to submit, some, however, with so poor a
grace that Mr. Hollis, smilingly genially remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, boys, be sports. Any fellow can
growl but it takes an all-around manly one to
bear defeat smilingly. There&rsquo;s always the
chance of better luck next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words and manner speedily dissipated
what shreds of ill-temper remained, so that the
boys gave a rousing cheer for a send-off as the
car, gleaming like red gold in the brilliant morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sunshine, shot off up the road and disappeared
from their longing eyes.</p>

<p>As for the fortunate three in the car, everything
unpleasant was forgotten in the twinkling
of an eye. A great splendid flying auto is no
place for disagreeable memories, and the woods
rang with song and jokes and laughter as the
car flew on.</p>

<p>Out of the woods at last they swept into a
wide well-kept turnpike, where they could safely
ride at greater speed.</p>

<p>Bert opened up the throttle and the &ldquo;Red
Scout&rdquo; fairly &ldquo;burned up the ground.&rdquo; They
passed a number of lumbering ox carts and farm
wagons drawn by sedate old horses, whom nothing
could dismay. Now just in front of them
they saw a runabout, drawn by two spirited bay
horses evidently of the thoroughbred type.</p>

<p>As they came up behind the carriage, Tom
noticed that one of the horses began to prance
and that the lady who held the reins glanced behind
nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you better go rather slow,&rdquo; he cautioned
Bert; &ldquo;one of those horses doesn&rsquo;t seem
to have any love for automobiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, Bert was very careful as he attempted
to pass the runabout; but at the first
glimpse of the car the prancing horse reared up
on his hind legs and lurched heavily against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
mate. Startled, the other horse plunged forward,
jerking the reins from the driver&rsquo;s hands.
The feel of the loose reins on their backs completed
their panic, and before anyone realized
what was happening, the horses had taken the bit
between their teeth and were dashing down the
road, utterly beyond control. The carriage
swayed frightfully from side to side, and the
two ladies, their faces blanched with fear, clung
desperately to the seats.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;lucky three,&rdquo; feeling not a bit lucky at
that moment, were filled with dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s our fault,&rdquo; groaned Tom,
&ldquo;although I don&rsquo;t for the life of me see how we
could have helped it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the question,&rdquo; said Bert, anxiously,
&ldquo;the only thing now is how to help
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that the thing
to do is to overtake them, range up alongside and
then one of us jump into the carriage and get
hold of the reins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed the only feasible thing and the
speeding auto soon came within a few feet of
the runaways. Bert waited till the road widened
and then shot the auto over the intervening space
and drew alongside. Tom grasped the wheel
and Bert, watching his chance, sprang into the
carriage. The double motion hurled him backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and almost out on the road, but with a desperate
effort, he succeeded in grasping the back
of the seat and held on. Then climbing over, he
made his perilous way out upon the shaft between
the flying horses and snatched the reins. Upon
these he pulled and sawed with all his strength
until he at last brought the frightened beasts under
control.</p>

<p>Tom and Ben, seeing their opportunity, stopped
the machine, and, running to the horses&rsquo;
heads, brought them to a standstill. They
helped the trembling women to alight and with
cushions and robes hastily brought from the auto
made them a comfortable seat at the foot of a
tree by the roadside. Ben, bethinking himself
of the drinking cup that was part of the auto&rsquo;s
equipment, filled it with water from a nearby
spring, and under these attentions the ladies
somewhat recovered from their terrifying experience.
The elder of the two turned to the
boys and tried to express her heartfelt gratitude,
while, if the younger was to be believed, they had
proved themselves veritable heroes. This they
modestly disclaimed and declared they were only
too delighted to have been able to stop the team
before any serious harm had been done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the horses stood panting and
trembling at the side of the road. Evidently it
would not be safe to attempt to drive them again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
at present, and they were greatly relieved when
a young farmer, who had seen the runaway,
came up and offered to keep them overnight in
his barn.</p>

<p>The horses thus disposed of, the &ldquo;lucky
three&rdquo; offered gallantly to drive the ladies home
in their car. So, fastening the runabout to the
rear of the auto and seating their guests comfortably
in the tonneau, the boys crowded into
the driver&rsquo;s seat and were soon gliding up a broad
avenue of elms that ended at the spacious and
elegant home to which they had been directed.
Declining a pressing invitation to enter, the boys,
followed by their repeated thanks, started off
with redoubled speed on their original errand.</p>

<p>Without further adventure they secured their
supplies and turned toward home. What was
their surprise as they neared the camp to see a
procession of the fellows coming down the road,
some beating on imaginary drums, others blowing
on horns, still others with harmonicas and
jewsharps, but managing in some unaccountable
way to evolve the well-known air of</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hark! The Conquering Hero Comes!&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>It was evident that the news of their adventure
had preceded them.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Gray Ghost,&rdquo; coming over to the camp
to discuss some detail of the forthcoming race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
had overtaken the farmer leading the runaway
horses and had learned the particulars. Hence
the impromptu band and the nerve-racking rendition
of the triumphal welcome. It was comical
but cordial, and the boys would not have been
human had they failed to appreciate it. And
later on their hearts thrilled with still greater
pleasure at Mr. Hollis&rsquo; earnest words of commendation.</p>

<p>They were soon seated at the table with their
guests from the rival camp, and in the discussion
of the anticipated race all else was forgotten.
They had not finished before a strange automobile
rolled up and the colored chauffeur lifting a
large basket from the car and bowing low, announced
that it was for Mr. Bert Wilson and
his friends from the ladies whom they had rescued
that day from deadly peril.</p>

<p>Many and loud were the exclamations of delight
when the basket was found to be filled with
the mostly costly and delicious fruit. Before
the onslaught of the crowd it vanished like magic
and Jim urged the boys to stop a team of runaways
every day that summer.</p>

<p>The fruit seemed to the boys the last souvenir
of that memorable day, so crowded with incident
and accident. But it was not. The &ldquo;lucky
three&rdquo; were to be reminded of this day&rsquo;s adventure
in a most unexpected manner before the season
ended.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Four-Legged Recruit</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;Don, boy, look here,&rdquo; cried Bert, coming
out of the mess tent after dinner with a
plate of scraps. &ldquo;Now how are you going to
thank me for it?&rdquo; he asked as Don pranced up,
barking and wig-wagging with his tail.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;s answer was to stick his cold muzzle into
Bert&rsquo;s hand and to wig-wag a little harder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, old fellow,&rdquo; said Bert when Don had
cleared the plate, &ldquo;some of the boys are hunting
butterflies over there and I want you to get this
note to them right away. Do you understand,
Beauty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dog looked up with full understanding in
the eyes that said so much and barked joyfully
as Bert tied the note to his collar. He started
off in the direction pointed out to him perfectly
happy in the thought that he was serving his
master.</p>

<p>Bert looked fondly after the proudly lifted
head and waving silver brush of his favorite.
The dog had been a mystery to the whole camp.
He seemed to know what was said to him and
scarcely ever failed to carry out any directions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
given him. He had learned a great many tricks
in the few days he had been in camp besides displaying
some he had mastered previously. With
one accord they decided that he must have been
stolen by the tramps, who, in the discomfort and
excitement of the other day, had forgotten all
about him.</p>

<p>A squad of the boys had that morning been
sent over to the hills on an all-day hike to hunt
for butterflies and to study ants&mdash;the last had
become a favorite amusement among them since
Dick&rsquo;s talk of a few days before. Bert had expected
to go with them, but, as more supplies
were needed from the village, he had volunteered
to go over for them in the &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; although
he would much rather have gone with the &ldquo;bug
squad.&rdquo; The note that he had entrusted to Don
contained a warning to the boys to come home
by the main road and not attempt to come over
the hills as they contained many dangerous holes
and pitfalls. He was sure that Don could find
the boys because he had gone with them more than
once on their hikes among the hills.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, up in the hills, one of the boys,
Arthur Gray by name, had wandered way off
from his fellows before he realized it. A strikingly
beautiful butterfly had led him on and on,
now lingering on one flower, now on another,
always flitting away at the very instant when Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
felt sure of success. Finally, with a lazily
graceful motion of its delicately marked wings,
it flew away and was lost to sight, leaving Arthur
to &ldquo;mop his fevered brow,&rdquo; as Dick would
have said.</p>

<p>Looking around him he discovered that the
boys were nowhere to be found. He reached
for his pocket compass and found, to his great
surprise and dismay, that it wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>By this time, really worried, he tried to remember
where he was and which way he had
come, but all with no result. The butterfly had
led him there by such a roundabout path that he
could not, for the life of him, point out the direction
from which he had come. What should
he do? In a moment he thought that he had
brought his watch with him&mdash;more by luck than
anything else, for he often left it at the camp&mdash;and
he remembered that he could find in what direction
the South lay by means of it.</p>

<p>By that time it was exactly four o&rsquo;clock, and,
pointing the hour hand toward the sun, he found
that the number 2 on his watch-face pointed to
the South: that is, half the distance between four
o&rsquo;clock and twelve when the other hand is pointed
toward the sun, marks the southerly direction.
Of course, when he had one point of the compass
it was very simple for him to find the others&mdash;that
being a necessary part of summer camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
training. Arthur knew that the camp lay somewhere
to the East so he started to get there as
fast as his legs would carry him.</p>

<p>But, alas. The time when we think fate has
been most kind to us often turns out to be the
time when it is hardest. So it was in Arthur&rsquo;s
case. As he hurried along, congratulating himself
on having thought of so easy and quick a way
to get out of his difficulty, he forgot that the
passes over the hills had been reported dangerous.</p>

<p>Going happily along he had no warning of
what was in store for him until, with a groan, he
sank to the ground and began to rub his ankle.
He had stepped into one of those treacherous
holes that covered the whole countryside and had
sprained his ankle very badly.</p>

<p>Painfully, he tried to get up, but when he attempted
to bear his weight on the injured ankle,
it pained so cruelly that he winced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he moaned aloud in
his misery. &ldquo;What shall I do, what shall I
do?&rdquo; and, sinking to the ground, he covered his
face with his hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, the boys had missed him and had
begun to search all over for him. Not finding
him, they became anxious and looked desperately
for him in every place they could think of.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he could be hiding in a cave the
way Jim was doing the other day,&rdquo; Shorty suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Shorty,&rdquo; said Tom, rather
sharply. &ldquo;Arthur isn&rsquo;t that kind. Probably
he&rsquo;s chased some butterfly way off somewhere and
can&rsquo;t find his way back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ought to be able to find his way easily
enough with his pocket compass. The thing
I&rsquo;m afraid of is that he may have met with some
accident,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>Just then Don came trotting up to Tom, calling
attention to the note tied to his collar by a
series of short, imperative barks. Tom patted
his head lovingly and called him a &ldquo;good fellow&rdquo;
at which Don wig-wagged vigorously.
The boys all crowded around, eager to see what
was in the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Bert,&rdquo; Tom announced, &ldquo;and he
says that Mr. Hollis wants us to come home by
the main road because of the dangerous holes
and pitfalls. Say, fellows,&rdquo; as the truth
dawned upon him, &ldquo;do you think that Arthur
can be hurt so that he can&rsquo;t get to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows. But I know one thing,&rdquo;
said Shorty stoutly, &ldquo;and that is, that I won&rsquo;t
leave these hills to-night until we have found
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Shorty,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
know we all feel the same way so we had better
get down to business in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the time the boys had been speaking Don
had stood with his head cocked knowingly on one
side, watching their every action. When they
started to go he looked up into Tom&rsquo;s face, mutely
asking to be allowed to go too. And Tom answered
heartily, &ldquo;You just bet you can come
along, Don. We couldn&rsquo;t do without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the boys began to scour the woods in
good earnest. For half an hour they worked
hard with a dull, aching sensation at their
hearts. They looked behind rocks, pulled aside
dense underbrush, gazed down deep ravines with
the awful fear that they might see their comrade
lying at the bottom. They were coming now into
the most dangerous part of the country and they
were forced to work slowly and with the utmost
care.</p>

<p>When they paused, weary and discouraged, to
consult on what course was best to follow,
Don&rsquo;s short bark reached their ears and in a minute
the dog himself rushed up to them. Then,
running back and forth between them and the
direction from which he had come, he plainly
showed them that he wished them to follow him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;He may have
found him, or at least some trace of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, with Don in the lead the boys started once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
more. As they went they called Arthur&rsquo;s name,
but at first nothing but the echoes answered
them. They were so torn by thorns and briers
and so wearied by the long search, that nothing
but the thought that their poor comrade was in
a much worse plight than they, could have kept
them to their task. Finally, when they were beginning
to think that Don was leading them on a
wrong scent, they heard a faint cry. Joyfully,
they called out again and again and each time
the answer came nearer. When they came upon
the runaway at last they were so happy that they
didn&rsquo;t notice his condition at once. When they
did realize how badly he was hurt, they forgot
how tired they were and set about at once to relieve
him.</p>

<p>The poor boy had tried to drag himself along
on his hands but had not been able to get very
far. The boys bandaged the ankle and then began
making a litter. It wasn&rsquo;t very long before
they had Arthur fairly comfortable on the improvised
bed. With light hearts the procession
started for camp, Don proudly taking the lead.
The boys thought it was best not to question Arthur
until he had had time to recover from the
shock.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark, when, tired and hungry, the
&ldquo;bug squad&rdquo; reached camp. It is a well known
fact that boys are not worth much when they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hungry. Mr. Hollis, who was a good judge of
human nature, hurried the troop into supper, declaring
that curiosity could be much better satisfied
on a full stomach than an empty one.</p>

<p>After supper the boys made the usual camp fire
and made the wounded hero of the day comfortable
before it. When the preliminaries were over
the boys called for the story of the &ldquo;bug
squad&rsquo;s&rdquo; adventures.</p>

<p>Tom told as much of the story as he knew and
then, turning to Arthur, asked, &ldquo;Did Don really
find you there? We weren&rsquo;t sure but that he
might just have struck the trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did both,&rdquo; Arthur replied. &ldquo;He struck
my trail and followed it until he found me. I
don&rsquo;t think I was ever so glad in my life as I was
to see our Don come trotting up ready for some
petting. He saw that I was hurt, though, and
started away like a streak of lightning to bring
you to my help. At first I thought that he was
deserting me, but even as the thought came to
me I knew it was unjust. Think of our gallant
Don deserting anyone in distress. Then in a
few minutes I heard you hail and answered as
well as I could. I will always carry a picture of
you fellows as you came into sight, with Don in
the lead. Believe me, it was the finest I ever
saw or expect to see. And now, fellows, I want
you to give three cheers for the hero of the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and the finest dog that ever lived. Come on,
now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;HOORAY-HOORAY-HOORAY&mdash;Now let
&rsquo;er out fellows&mdash;HOORAY,&rdquo; and in spite of his
sprained ankle, Arthur led the cheers that
echoed and re-echoed through the trees for rods
around.</p>

<p>All the time the cause of all the enthusiasm
was lying with his head on Bert&rsquo;s knee, watching
the boys contentedly. When they all crowded
around, he took the praises they showered on him
as a true gentleman should&mdash;with courtesy and
dignity, only those speaking eyes of his telling of
the love in his heart for the boys that would have
made him die for any one of them.</p>

<p>If ever a dog was glad and happy, his name
was Don that night. Although he didn&rsquo;t understand
what it was all about, he knew that he
was being honored and showed that he appreciated
it.</p>

<p>The happiest moment in the whole day for
Don came when Bert put both arms lovingly
around his neck and whispered, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
trump, old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the four-legged recruit went happily
to sleep to dream that he was rescuing all the
boys in camp.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Youngsters&rsquo; Great Day</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; said Bert, as he lay stretched
out lazily beneath the limbs of a spreading
beech, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t this the finest day ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet it is,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;the mould was
broken when this day was made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was, indeed, one of the perfect days that
come sometimes to break the heat of sweltering
midsummer. A brisk wind stirred the branches
through which the sunlight, flecking lazily the
ground beneath, played over the group of boys,
who lay in all sorts of abandoned attitudes on a
bit of rising ground a little removed from the
camp. They had had a splendid morning&rsquo;s
sport. The coolness of the day and the fine condition
of the roads and meadows had suggested
to them the game of Hare and Hounds. Up hill
and down dale they had raced with occasional intervals
of rest. When the hares had successfully
shaken off their pursuers, still the bewildered
hounds had nosed about, so to speak, seeking
to pick up the lost trail. Bert and Tom had
been the hares and their escape from capture had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
added to the delight occasioned by the day and
the game itself. It was only after the rice that
they had carried in their pouches to make a trail
had been almost exhausted, that they thought of
doubling on their tracks and making for camp.</p>

<p>The hounds had trailed in a little later on,
looking a bit discomfited but not disheartened.
As Pete Hart, one of the hounds, said &ldquo;though
slightly disfigured they were still in the ring.&rdquo;
And, oh, how that dinner tasted and how impossible
it was almost for the famished boys to wait
while the fish snatched from the brook that morning
were frizzling in the pan and came in tantalizing
whiffs to the nostrils of the boys. Something
more substantial than whiffs, however, did
quickly follow, and now like gorged anacondas
full to the brim, they lay stretched out upon the
grass and talked over the events of the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, boys,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;it sure
was the luckiest day in my life when I struck this
camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I reckon we all say
amen to that. Think of being out in these woods
on such a day as this with a lot of jolly good fellows
and not a thing to do but be happy. When
I think of the people in town roasting under the
summer heat while we are out here under the
trees, you bet I feel sorry for them.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jim, who, as usual, had eaten
more even than the others and hadn&rsquo;t before had
energy enough to speak, &ldquo;the town is all right
in the fall and spring, but when the summer
comes, me for the long hike and the camp in the
woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure does us a lot of good,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;I
know that when I go back to the city after a
summer like this I feel so strong that I could
lift a ton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God made the country but man made the
town,&rdquo; chimed in Dick who was great on quotations.
&ldquo;I think it does everybody good to get
away somewhere where they can come in contact
with the woods and the brooks and the squirrels
and the birds. Who was it we used to read
about&mdash;that fellow in the old Grecian stories&mdash;I
think his name was Antaeus, who got into a fight
with one of the old heroes and every time he was
knocked down, refreshed by contact with mother
earth, got up ten times stronger than before. I
guess that is the way we feel after a summer
spent in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they were speaking, Mr. Hollis had
joined the group. The boys quickly moved aside
to make room for him. Although he was so
much older than they, his genial spirit and unfailing
friendliness kept him in touch with every
one of the boys. At heart he was still a boy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
always would be one. He was a stickler for
discipline, but not in the slightest degree a martinet.
With him it was always the &ldquo;iron hand
in the velvet glove,&rdquo; and he was so just, so considerate,
he understood boy nature so thoroughly
and in the case of each was able so accurately
to put himself in his place, that the boys
regarded him as a father or rather an older
brother, instead of a commander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard what you said, Tom,&rdquo; he said, smiling,
&ldquo;about not having a thing to do but be
happy. Are you quite sure you have nothing to
do but that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom stared a moment, &ldquo;why yes,&rdquo; he said
slowly, &ldquo;to make somebody else happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis. &ldquo;You
hit the nail right on the head that time, Tom.
There is no higher aim in life than to make some
one else happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur of assent arose from the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis, &ldquo;we ought to do
some one a good turn every day. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter especially what that good turn is. It may
be a thing so slight as almost to escape notice.
It is just in some way or other to add to the
sweetness of human life. It may be to give
somebody a lift in the automobile&mdash;it may be a
word of appreciation to kindle a smile on some
tired face; it may be guiding a blind man across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the street, or giving your seat to a woman in the
street car, or even so slight a thing as to kick a
banana peel off the sidewalk. The essence of
the whole thing is self-forgetfulness. To lend a
hand, to give a lift, to make life brighter and
easier for someone even in the smallest degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what I have in mind just now is a sort
of wholesale lift. When I was in town the other
day I passed the orphan asylum. You know the
one I mean. That building just off the Court
House Square with a stone wall around it and a
pretty lawn in front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys remembered perfectly. Every one
of them at some time or other had passed the
place and seen the childish faces at the windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis, &ldquo;my idea is this.
There are from forty to fifty children in that
building. It serves as the asylum for all the
towns in the county. I happen to know it is
carried on in a splendid way. The officials at
the head are kind and humane and the matrons
in charge take the best possible care of the little
ones, but after all they need variety. They want
individual attention. In a home of that kind
even with the best intentions there has to be a
certain monotony and uniformity. They have to
rise at a certain hour, sit down at the table at
the same moment, go to the school room at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
given time, and even play under the direction of
somebody else. Now, what a glorious thing it
would be if for one day those children could
come out into the woods and roll in the grass and
chase the squirrels and kick up their heels like
young colts let loose in the pasture. What do
you say boys, to giving up one whole day of this
vacation and make those little ones think they
have had a glimpse of heaven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What they said was plenty. As Shorty said,
&ldquo;it hit them where they lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of excited exclamations,
&ldquo;Will we?&rdquo; &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; &ldquo;Just try us
and see.&rdquo; &ldquo;When&rsquo;s it going to be?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why
can&rsquo;t we have it to-morrow?&rdquo; &ldquo;How many kids
are there in the asylum?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best
way to get them here?&rdquo; At last Mr. Hollis,
smiling, had to raise his hand, in order to be
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t fixed upon the
date. As a matter of fact, I haven&rsquo;t spoken to
the officers of the institution at all and am not
absolutely sure that they will see their way clear
to make the arrangement. Of course, they have
a great responsibility upon them in caring for so
many little ones and they would have to look at
the question from every side. Still I don&rsquo;t think
there will be much trouble in arranging it. They
are just as eager to see the children have a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
time as we are, and I think the idea will strike
them as a capital one. One or two of the people
in charge will, of course, have to come with
them. Ordinarily they might feel a little timid
about letting the children spend a whole day in
the woods in company with a lot of high-spirited
boys who might be reckless, and, even with the
best intentions, lead them into danger. Still,
you boys have established such a good reputation
in this neighborhood,&rdquo; and here Mr. Hollis
looked about on the eager faces with an expression
of pride, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t think there will
be any real trouble in arranging the affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a capital idea,&rdquo; said Dick, warmly.
&ldquo;How did you come to think about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t original
with me. It&rsquo;s a custom in the city to set aside a
day each year as &lsquo;Orphans&rsquo; Day.&rsquo; There are
thousands of well-to-do people, owners of automobiles,
who have the tenderest sympathy with
these little ones deprived, by nature, of their
natural guardians, and on that one day of the
year they give up all thought of selfish enjoyment
and try to give the children the time of their
lives. It&rsquo;s a splendid sight and warms the heart
to see the long line of automobiles coming down
the avenues decked with flags and overflowing
with the little tots. Off they go to the beach
where all sorts of amusements have been prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
for them. They dig in the sand. They
paddle about with bare feet at the edge of the
breakers. They take in every innocent amusement
from one end of the island to another.
They haven&rsquo;t any money to spend, but they
couldn&rsquo;t spend it if they had. Everything is free.
The spirit of kindness and good feeling is shared
by all the owners of the different resorts, and
the doors are flung wide open the minute the children
come in sight. They see the moving pictures.
They ride in the merry-go-round. They
hold their breath as they speed up and down the
scenic railways. They watch, with awed admiration,
the wandering artist who moulds tigers and
lions in the sand. The life guards take them in
their boats and row around the different piers.
They go to the great animal shows and see the
big brutes put through their wonderful tricks.
They sit in the weighing machines. They throw
base-balls at the clay figures and the larger boys
are even permitted&mdash;supreme pleasure for a boy&mdash;to
fire at the target in the shooting galleries.
They watch the great ocean steamers as they go
past at a distance, and the smaller vessels, like
white-winged birds, that hug the shore. And
eat! How they do eat! They are like a flock
of ravenous locusts and the food disappears as
if by magic. It&rsquo;s a day of days for the poor little
youngsters, to be talked over and dreamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
over for months to come, and when at the end
of the day they pile into the autos, tired, full,
happy as larks, for the swift return journey to
the only place they know as home, it is a question
who are the happier, the little ones to whom
this means so much or the owners of the machines
who, for that one day at least have
spent themselves gladly for the happiness of
others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys listened with rapt attention, and
when Mr. Hollis had finished they were chock
full of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t any beach
here, but I am willing to bet that by the time we
get through with those kids they will have had
just as good a time as any youngster in the big
city ever had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys all chimed assent to this, and Shorty,
who was always impulsive and never could bear
to wait for anything that he greatly desired, suggested,
&ldquo;Why not fix it up right away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any
objection to that. If Bert has the automobile in
shape we will go over at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So many of the boys wanted to go with him
that, to avoid any selection, Mr. Hollis suggested
that they draw lots. Of course it went
without saying that Bert would go to drive the
machine, but in addition fate decreed that Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Frank, Jim, and Shorty should pile in with them.
Off they went along the smooth country roads,
their hearts leaping not only with the delight of
the glorious day and the thrilling swiftness with
which the great machine sped over the turnpike,
but also from the feeling that they were going to
carry gladness and sunshine into a lot of wistful
little hearts to whom father and mother were
only names.</p>

<p>In what seemed only a few minutes from the
time they left the camp, they reached the asylum.
Bert went in with Mr. Hollis while the rest of
the boys stayed outside in the machine of which
they never tired, and where they much preferred
to stay rather than wander about the streets of
the town. The interview with the officers of the
asylum was most cordial. They knew Mr. Hollis
as a courteous gentleman and a capable and
careful ruler of his little kingdom. The matron
in charge was called in at the conference and she
also assented heartily and thankfully.</p>

<p>It was arranged that on the second day thereafter,
provided, of course, the weather was suitable,
the outing should take place. Then arose
the question of transportation. How were they
to get there? The automobile would only carry
a few of the little ones even though they were
packed in like sardines. The superintendent
suggested that no doubt they would be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
find plenty of the townspeople who would be glad
to furnish teams to carry the rest.</p>

<p>But just before this arrangement was concluded
a thought occurred to Bert. He knew
how much the auto appealed to a youngster.
They were used to seeing horses and wagons and
at times would be taken for a ride in them, but
automobiles were scarce in that locality and
seemed almost like a fairy vehicle to the little
ones, as with faces pressed against the panes they
would see an occasional touring car glide swiftly
along the road in front. &ldquo;Where were the
horses?&rdquo; &ldquo;What made them go?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why do
they go so fast?&rdquo; It seemed to Bert that half the
delight of the little ones would be in the automobile
ride and as he pictured the little wave of
envy and discontent that would inevitably come
over the youngsters who were forced to take the
more prosaic and common place wagons, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with taking them all over
in the machine? Of course we would have to
make a good many trips, but what of that? It
only takes a few minutes to get from here to the
camp and turn our load loose in the woods and
then come back for another. The whole thing
could be managed in a couple of hours. Bob and
I could take turns in driving the machine. I am
sure Bob would be glad to, and I know I would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and as for the kids, there is no question of the
way they would feel about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis, while the superintendent
and matron greeted gratefully this further
example of Bert&rsquo;s thoughtfulness and kindness
of heart.</p>

<p>When the machine returned to camp and the
boys who had been left behind learned of the arrangement,
everything was bustle and stir at once.
Although the camp was always kept in first-class
order, this being one of their cardinal principles,
yet there were a good many little things that
needed doing in order that the youngsters should
have the glorious time that the boys had mapped
out for them. Some of them took a long rope
and fixed up a great swing between two oaks at
a little distance from the camp. Others arranged
an archery butt and prepared bows and arrows
for the larger boys to use. A number of fishing
lines with sinkers and hooks were prepared so
that the children might have the rare delight of
trying to catch their own dinner. Then, too, it
was necessary to go to town on several different
occasions to secure supplies. Their own store
had to be replenished, and besides, they wanted
to get a lot of extra dainties that would appeal
especially to the appetites of their little guests.</p>

<p>There had been a heavy rain a day or two before
and the prospects were that nothing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
way of bad weather would mar the outing. This
had been a question of a little anxiety because
their stay in camp was rapidly nearing a close.
Many of the boys had only a limited time to
stay and had to return to their employment in
the city. And even those who could extend the
period had no desire to do so after their fellows
had gone.</p>

<p>In all this rush of preparation the automobile
race was not neglected. Every boy in the camp
felt as though his own personal reputation was
involved in winning. Rumors had filtered in
from different quarters that Ralph Quinby, the
driver of the &ldquo;Gray Ghost,&rdquo; was simply burning up
the roads in exercise. It was even said that for
a short distance he had attained the speed of a
mile a minute.</p>

<p>While there was no bitterness in the rivalry
between the two camps, yet their desire to win
was extremely keen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have simply got to get there, old fellow,&rdquo;
said Dick as he and Bert were tinkering
at the machine on the morning before that set
for the outing. &ldquo;It would never do to have
those fellows say that the &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; had to take
the dust of the &lsquo;Gray Ghost.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert, who, as the driver of the
car, naturally felt a greater weight of responsibility
than anybody else, &ldquo;there are just three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
things we need in order to come in first. Above
everything else, we&rsquo;ve got to have the car in
splendid condition. It must be stripped of every
single thing that might furnish wind resistance
and make its work that much harder. Every bolt
and nut must be examined and tightened. The
lever, the clutch, the gear, has to be thoroughly
examined. Many a race is won in advance in
this way, even before the machine leaves the
post. In the next place, we&rsquo;ve got to have good
judgment. By this I mean judgment of pace. It
isn&rsquo;t only what the speedometer says, but there
is a little something that tells the man who has
his hand on the wheel just when and just how
hard he should hit it up. Sometimes it is wise to
trail the other fellow. At other times it may be
well to set the pace, but the ability to do either
one or the other is the thing that, other things
being equal, is bound to tell in the long run.
Then, greatest of all, perhaps, is nerve. I don&rsquo;t
know whether you have ever ridden, Dick, in a
machine that goes a mile a minute, but if you
have, especially on a circular track, you&rsquo;ll know
something of what I mean. A fellow&rsquo;s nerves
must be like iron. The least hesitation, the least
doubt, the least shakiness even for the merest
fraction of a second, may be fatal. This is true
even if one were riding without anything especially
at stake, but when we know that all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fellows will be yelling like Indians, begging us
to win, and know the bitter disappointment that
will come to them if the other fellow shows us
the way over the line, I tell you it is a sure
enough test of a fellow&rsquo;s nerve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;as to that last point I
haven&rsquo;t any doubt about you having plenty of
nerve, Bert. If that were the only thing in
question I would call the race won just now, but
how about the machines themselves? Don&rsquo;t they
enter into the calculation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;that counts for an
awful lot. You can&rsquo;t make a cart horse beat a
thoroughbred, no matter how well he is ridden.
There&rsquo;s got to be the speed there or everything
else counts for nothing. But take two machines
of about equal power, and from all I hear the
&lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; hasn&rsquo;t much, if anything, on the &lsquo;Gray
Ghost&rsquo; in this particular, it puts the matter right
up to the drivers of the cars. Under those conditions,
nine times out of ten, it&rsquo;s the best man
and not the best machine that wins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Tom and Bert discussed the thing in
this way soberly, the rest of the troop hadn&rsquo;t a
doubt in the world that their hero would win.
They idolized Bert. They had seen him under
a variety of circumstances and never once had
he shown the white feather. Never once had
he failed to measure up to an emergency. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
once had he failed to use every ounce of energy
and power that he possessed. If he <i>should
lose</i>&mdash;and this thought was instantly dismissed as
traitorous&mdash;they knew that, although beaten, he
would not be disgraced, and so, with a vast
amount of excitement but with scarcely the
slightest feeling of trepidation, they awaited the
momentous day when the &ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; should battle for supremacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Orphans&rsquo; Day&rdquo; dawned clear and beautiful.
There was just enough breeze to temper the heat
of the sun. The skies were cloudless. Many a
tousled little head up at the asylum had tossed
restlessly on its pillow through that night and
almost all of the expectant youngsters needed no
rising bell to call them from their dreams. Even
breakfast was dispatched more quickly than
usual, and the feverish impatience of the little
tots made it almost impossible to wait for the
coming of that glorious automobile.</p>

<p>As it was necessary to save all possible space
in the auto for the children themselves, Bert
drove the car over alone. When he came in
sight he was hailed with a yell of delight by a
little group of seven or eight gathered on the
lawn, who had been told off, to the envy of their
less fortunate companions, for the first ride. The
matron in charge made a pretense of keeping
order, but she had been a child herself and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
attempt was only half-hearted. In they piled,
one after the other, tumbling over the sides, or
tossed in by the strong arms of Bert, and untangled
themselves somehow, some on the seats,
some on the bottom of the car between the last
and the driver&rsquo;s seat. Brown heads, black heads,
blond heads, yes, even one little red head&mdash;that
of Teddy Mulligan&mdash;made what Shorty said
when he saw it was &ldquo;a sure enough color
scheme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as they were safely ensconced, Bert
blew his horn, swung the car around, and then
made off for the camp. Oh, the delight of that
swift trip on that glorious morning. Oh, the
chatter that rose from those eager lips. Oh, the
joy that bubbled in those little, motherless hearts.
It wasn&rsquo;t earth&mdash;it was heaven. On sped the machine,
noiselessly, softly, swiftly as a bird. If it
had not been for the other groups who were eagerly
waiting their turn Bert would surely have
turned off into a side road and given the kids a
good many extra miles; but the others had to be
considered, too, and time was passing, so into the
camp they glided, all alive with eagerness, delight
and anticipation. The ready hands of the
other boys lifted the little ones from the machine,
which instantly turned about for its second
trip. Again and again this was repeated, until
the last little group on the lawn of the asylum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
had melted away, and the woods resounded with
their childish prattle.</p>

<p>The boys had surely spread themselves to give
&ldquo;the kids&rdquo; a day that they&rsquo;d never forget.
Frank took some of the larger boys to the little
glade where the archery practice was on, put the
bows and arrows into their hands that had been
prepared and showed them how to shoot. The
girls were taken to a swing that the boys had
rigged up and swung to and fro to their hearts&rsquo;
content. Tom showed them how to make jack-o&rsquo;-lanterns
and told them about the time when
Bert had put one up in a great cave and frightened
him so badly when he caught a first glimpse
of it. A little group under the guidance of Dick
went down to the brook and watched the sunfish
dart to and fro under the gleaming surface and
the great perch and catfish lying lazily under the
reeds that fringed the bank. Shorty, who was
an expert fisherman, threw his line while the boys
looked on with bated breath, and in a few minutes
pulled up a plump catfish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do they call them that?&rdquo; said little
Tony Darimo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Shorty, &ldquo;maybe it&rsquo;s because of
the whiskers they have; perhaps because the face
looks something like a cat, or else because of the
noise they make when you take them off the
hook.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Billy Jackson seemed unconvinced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me like a cat,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Just then Shorty, who had turned his head to
put the fish in the basket, uttered a loud
&ldquo;meow.&rdquo; Billy jumped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you are right after all,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It surely does sound like a pussy cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the shallow part of the brook some of the
little ones under the guidance of the matron were
permitted to take off their shoes and stockings
and paddle about. The water was less than a
foot deep. One of the children slipped and fell.
In a moment Don, who had been racing along
the bank, jumped in and grabbed him by the
collar of his blouse. The child was on his feet
in a minute and had never been in the slightest
danger at all, but Don felt just as proud of his
exploit as though he had saved him from a raging
torrent. The boys laughed and called him a
&ldquo;fake hero,&rdquo; and yet every one of them knew in
his heart that, however great might have been
the danger, Don would have jumped just the
same. Don outdid himself that day. He made
the children scream with delight. Under the
guidance of Bert he played soldier, shouldered
the stick and marched, rolled over and played
dead, and did it all with such a keen sense of enjoyment
in his tricks that the children stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
about and watched him, with endless wonder and
delight.</p>

<p>But the one whom the children remembered
above all the others was Bert. He was everywhere.
He told them stories. He carried them
on his shoulders. He imitated the calls of the
different birds. He summoned the squirrels and
the timid little creatures, who long since had lost
all fear of him, came readily forward, ate out
of his hand and perched upon his finger tips.
The children looked on with wide-eyed amazement,
delight and admiration.</p>

<p>Then came dinner, and such a dinner! The
kids had never seen anything like it before.
Fish caught fresh from the brook, the golden
corn bread made by the boys themselves, the
maple syrup, the cakes, the pies, the countless
goodies that melted away before those famished
youngsters would have filled a dyspeptic&rsquo;s heart
with envy.</p>

<p>But all things come to an end, and in the late
afternoon, amid the shouted good-byes and waving
of hands from all the boys in the camp, the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; took up its burden&mdash;and it had never
borne a happier one&mdash;and carried the kids away,
their little hearts full of unspeakable content, at
the end of the best day&rsquo;s outing they had ever
known.</p>

<p>The boys were tired that night. Even Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
who prided himself on never owning up to weariness,
admitted fairly and squarely that he was
&ldquo;clean tuckered out.&rdquo; But it was a delightful
weariness. They had forgotten themselves.
They had worked and planned for others. They
had not looked for their own happiness, and just
because they had not, they found it. They had
learned the one supreme lesson of life, &ldquo;that to
give is better than to receive,&rdquo; &ldquo;that he who
seeks pleasure as an end in itself never finds it,&rdquo;
and that he who bestows happiness upon another
has his own heart flooded with peace.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dave&rsquo;s Tiger Story</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The next night, while Dave, who had promised
to tell them a tiger yarn, was pulling
his &ldquo;thinking cap&rdquo; on tight, and trying to select
his most fetching story, the boys gathered closer
about him, and with hearts beating a little faster
at the very mention of the word &ldquo;tiger,&rdquo; prepared
to listen.</p>

<p>At last Dave looked up, and in order to make
his story a trifle more thrilling, gave a little talk
on the bloodthirstiness of his majesty, the tiger.
When he concluded by the tense look on his
hearers&rsquo; faces that the right moment had arrived,
he plunged into</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">The Story of the Tiger</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;One calm evening in the summertime, somewhat
later than usual, a gentleman stepped from
the train at a railroad station in a suburban town
and walked up the street toward his home. Deep
in thoughts of business, he did not notice at first
that a most unusual silence pervaded the town.
In a short time the deadly stillness roused him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and he noticed, wonderingly, that he was the only
person to be seen on the streets. Not a man,
woman, or child could he see, a most unusual
thing, as at that time, in the early evening, the
town was always a very lively place indeed. He
noticed, too, with amazement, that the doors and
windows of the houses were all closed. Not a
face appeared at any of them. All the windows
that had blinds or shutters attached had them
drawn tightly, and fastened securely. Not a sign
of life anywhere. What had happened? Had
everybody gone crazy?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amazed and frightened, he hurried on, up
one street and down another, until his own house
came into view. That, too, was closed and shuttered.
The welcoming face that had never failed
to greet him was not at door or window. Now,
thoroughly alarmed, he ran up the steps of the
porch and wildly rang the bell. The door was
opened cautiously, just a little crack, and to his
great relief the face of his wife appeared at the
tiny opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the sight of him the door opened wider.
He was clutched by the sleeve and hurried into
the house with scant ceremony. Before he could
get his breath after this amazing treatment the
door was closed and locked and double-locked
on the instant, and the white face of his wife
confronted the dazed man.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;His dinner was ready, but without waiting for
him to be seated at the table his wife commenced
to tell him the cause of the unusual state of affairs.
&lsquo;Did he remember that the wild animal
show was to have arrived in the town that day?&rsquo;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he had not remembered, &lsquo;but go on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it did come, and while the show was
in progress one of the animals, a tiger, had
escaped from the tent and raced up Main Street,
while everyone on the street hurried to the nearest
refuge. At the end of Main Street he dashed
into the woods, and though the crowd of pursuing
men and boys did their best to recapture him,
he was still at large. The manager of the show
told the people, while they ran madly in pursuit,
that the tiger was a new one, scarcely at all
trained, and by far the fiercest and most savage
of all the animals in the show. He warned
everyone to stay closely within doors that night,
and assured them that as soon as daylight appeared
every possible effort would be made to
capture and cage him. That is why everybody
is barricaded within doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, being a man, he laughed at his
wife&rsquo;s fears, said there was no danger, and that
it was extremely foolish for everyone to be so
scared, and that, as for him, he would not lose
a wink of sleep worrying about it. His wife
noticed, however, that although he talked so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
bravely, he kept closely within doors all the evening,
and that when they were ready to go upstairs
for the night he looked with unusual care at the
fastenings of all the doors and windows, both
upstairs and down. Once, as he fastened the bolt
of a window, he had stopped and grown a little
white at a slight scratching noise just outside the
window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here a decided shiver ran around the camp,
furtive looks were cast over hiked shoulders, and
Sam, who for some minutes had been watching
a moving shadow just outside the line of camp
firelight, decided that the shadow was decidedly
tigerlike, and wanted to know if they did not
think the fire needed some more logs. &ldquo;All
right, old man,&rdquo; said Bob, and the logs went on.
They blazed up brightly, and gave every man
Jack, even the bravest of them, a more comfortable
feeling of security, and Dave went on with
the story:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the middle of that night the man found
himself suddenly awake, with an intense feeling
that someone or something was in the room.
Raising himself upon one elbow, he gazed searchingly
about the dim room, and was just about to
give himself a lecture for imagining things, when,
in the farthest and darkest corner, he saw what
appeared to be two great balls of green fire
glaring straight at him. At once the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the escaped tiger leaped into his mind, and he
knew that the fierce and savage beast was within
his room. For a moment his heart fairly stopped
beating, but, gaining control of himself with an
effort, he tried to think what he should do. He
reached over and laid his hand softly over his
wife&rsquo;s lips and whispered in her ear. Then together
they watched the two glowing points of
fire, wondering with sick hearts how soon the
tiger would be upon them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had not long to wait, for now the tiger
began crawling toward them, inch by inch, inch
by inch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point in the story the boys, utterly forgetful
of the world and everything in it, had
crowded close about the story teller, and with
flesh creeping and hair rising on their heads were
listening, open-mouthed, to the story. Dave had
paused to take breath, when every heart stood
still as a fierce scratching on the bark of a nearby
tree and a deep, savage growling were heard.</p>

<p>All sprang to their feet. Dick Trent was the
only one who remained cool. Having seen Bert
Wilson (who never lost an opportunity for a little
fun and mischief) steal quietly away under
cover of the darkness, he more than suspected
that something was going to happen, and so was
prepared.</p>

<p>Suddenly a burst of ringing laughter made itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
heard, and there on the grass lay Bert, rolling
over and over, holding his sides and saying
between gasps, &ldquo;Oh, my! Oh, my! you did look
so funny! Hold me, somebody, or I <i>will</i> go to
pieces. Oh, my! Oh, my!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first the boys were inclined to be angry,
but they were good fellows and always ready to
laugh at a joke, even when it was on themselves,
and so with many a laughing threat to &ldquo;get even
with Bert, and that mighty soon,&rdquo; they came, a
little sheepishly, back to the fire and with one
accord begged Dave to go on with the story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Dave, &ldquo;we left the tiger
creeping inch by inch, inch by inch, toward his
two victims, and feeling very sure of his capture;
but the man was not the one to give up his life
or that of his wife without a brave effort to save
them. He whispered hastily to his wife, &lsquo;Be prepared&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;here
a voice interrupted to exclaim,
&ldquo;They ought to have been campers&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;to
jump out and roll way back under the bed the
instant I say Now!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this time the tiger had come to within a
few feet of them, and they could see him in the
dim light, every muscle quivering, crouched for
a spring. The man had slipped his feet over the
side of the bed to the floor, and his hands
clutched the bedclothes from underneath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the beast sprang the man shouted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
&lsquo;Now!&rsquo; and at the same time flung the bedclothes
over the head and body of the tiger.
The two terrified people used the few minutes
the angry, snarling beast took to get out from
the tangle of bedclothes to roll as far under the
bed as they could. The bed was a very low one,
and the man knew that the tiger, who was very
large, could not creep under without raising the
bed with his shoulders. So the two resolved that
when he tried to get under, as they knew he
would, they would grip the steel springs above
them and hold on like grim death, and try to
hold the bed down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All too soon they found themselves holding
on to those springs with all the combined strength
of their muscles. The tiger tried again and again
to lift the bed, but could not get enough of his
shoulders under to get a purchase, and finding
himself baffled, crept away to his far corner to
consider what to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man knew that they could not keep the
tiger at bay in this way very long, for their
strength was nearly gone. Groping about desperately,
his hand touched his son&rsquo;s tool box, pushed
carelessly under the bed. How thankful he was
that their boy was visiting relatives at a distance.
He, at least, was safe. He grasped the box as
a drowning man grasps a straw, and lifting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
lid searched for and found a screw driver, and,
oh, joy! a few large screws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working desperately, and more rapidly than
ever in his life before, he drove a couple of the
screws through the two top legs of the bed, securing
them to the floor. Another two minutes
and he had one of the bottom legs in the same
condition. Before he could touch the fourth leg
the tiger, angered by the noise of the screw driving,
bounded forward and again tried to lift the
bed. Finding he could not get at them, the tiger
suddenly sprang upon the bed and began tearing
at the mattress. Very soon there was nothing
between him and the now almost despairing
couple but the woven wire springs. These springs
were of extra strong, fine quality, but even these
could not hold out long against the onslaught of
those terrible, powerful claws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost mechanically the man again thrust
his hand into the box, and drew out a small saw.
The idea came to him to cut a hole through the
floor into the ceiling of the room below, slip
through, and rush for help. He spoke to his
wife, and found she had fainted. He worked
desperately, faster and faster, while all the time
the tiger tore more and more fiercely at the
tough springs. His hot, terrible breath swept
across their faces, so close to that snarling one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
above them, while the saliva dropped from his
savage jaws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost fainting with disgust and terror, the
man worked on still more desperately, for dear
life now. At last one side was finished, then another,
now the third, and a little hope came back
to the man&rsquo;s heart. If he could only finish that
other side he would have at least a slight chance
of escape. But now the tough woven wire links
began to give way under the tearing of the tiger&rsquo;s
savage claws. In one place a small hole is broken
in the wire. In mad haste the man tears the saw
through the wood. It seems as if it would never
give way. Once the saw slips and bends. What
if it should break! One more desperate, despairing
effort. Only two more inches now, only one,
only a half inch. At last it is over, and the saw
drops from his nerveless hand. He makes a last
effort to arouse his wife, but without avail. He
cannot bear to leave her, for he fears that before
he can get help and return the tiger will be upon
her. What can he do? It is his only chance to
save her. He <i>must</i> take it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tiger, as if he knew a crisis had come,
ceased his tearing and lay above them, watching
with angry fire flashing from his eyes, and keeping
up a low, savage snarling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a muttered prayer for protection for his
poor wife and help for himself, the man lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
himself through the opening until he found
himself suspended from the ceiling of the lower
room. In desperate haste to go for help, he is
about to drop to the floor, but pauses to hear if
there is any sound or movement in the room
above. Not a sound. There is comfort in that,
for his poor wife must be safe as yet, but what
is the tiger doing? Why is everything so deadly
quiet? Incensed at the escape of one of his victims,
one would suppose him to be all the more
eager to secure the other; but there is no sound.
What can he be doing?</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this moment an awful thought comes to
him. What if the cunning tiger had crept silently
down the stairs into the room below? He
remembers that the door into that room was
open when they passed it on their way upstairs.
How safe they had felt then! How little had
they dreamed that this awful thing would come
upon them! Could it be only a few hours since
they had gone upstairs, chatting cheerfully together?
It seemed days and days ago. Perhaps
the tiger was at that moment crouched below him
there in the darkness, ready to spring upon him
the moment, yes, even before, his feet touched
the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The awful thought made him pause, and he
hung there with fiercely throbbing heart, undecided
what to do. If he could hear one sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the tiger moving in the room above him he
could drop, quickly close the door, and rush
away for help. Still no sound from his wife&rsquo;s
room. What should he do? Perhaps it would
be better to try to hold on until morning, when
he could at least have the blessed light to aid
him. It could not be long now before daybreak.
Surely out of doors there must be daylight now.
Soon it would come into the room and enable him
to look about him. Yes, that would be the best
and only thing to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no; he cannot! His strength is failing.
Already his numbed fingers are slipping&mdash;slipping&mdash;another
moment and the tiger will be upon
him and all will be over. He can hold on no
longer. He is falling&mdash;falling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;John! Oh, John!&rsquo; comes a cheerful voice
from below. &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming down? It is
almost train time, and breakfast is ready.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John sits up in bed, looking with dazed eyes
all around the bright room, flooded with morning
sunshine, and it is minutes before he realizes
that it is <i>all a dream</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If anyone could have taken a photograph of
the boys&rsquo; faces just before the conclusion of the
story and another just after it, the two pictures
would have been a comic study; but they could
not have given the transition from faces filled
with rapt, motionless, breathless interest to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
astonished, somewhat disgusted look as the totally
unexpected ending of the story filtered in
upon them.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis, who had listened to the last part
of the story with as much interest as the boys,
thanked Dave for the pleasure he had given
them, but could not keep back a smile as Shorty
voiced the general sentiment, &ldquo;You ought to be
ashamed, Dave Ferris, for handing us such a
lemon.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">With Death Behind</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Pop! Pop! Bang! The &ldquo;Red Scout&rsquo;s&rdquo;
motor gave a few preliminary explosions,
and then started off with a sound like a whole
battery of field guns going off at once. A cloud
of black smoke issued from the exhaust, and in
a few seconds had enveloped the car so that it
could hardly be seen. Some of the boys came
running up with consternation written in their
faces, evidently thinking that the automobile was
about to explode, or run away, or do some
equally disastrous thing. They were reassured
by Bert&rsquo;s broad grin, however, and Bob Ward
gave a relieved laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter
with the old machine, anyway, Bert? You had
us scared stiff there for a few minutes. I thought
that after this when we wanted to get anywhere
we&rsquo;d have to walk, sure. It looked as though the
old &lsquo;Scout&rsquo; were on fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure did,&rdquo; confirmed Frank. &ldquo;What <i>was</i>
the matter, Bert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing to speak of,&rdquo; replied Bert airily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
&ldquo;I had just washed the engine out with a little
kerosene oil, and, when I started it, why, of
course that burned, and gave out the smoke you
saw. I don&rsquo;t wonder that you thought something
was up, though,&rdquo; he continued, laughing.
&ldquo;It certainly did look like the &lsquo;last days of Pompeii&rsquo;
for a few seconds, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it did,&rdquo; broke in Shorty, &ldquo;and
seeing all that smoke reminded me of a riddle
I heard a little while ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, Shorty, tell us the riddle and get it
out of your system,&rdquo; laughed Bert. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t it might grow inward and kill you. Some
brands of humor are apt to work that way, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the riddle is this,&rdquo; said Shorty.
&ldquo;Why is it that an automobile smokes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many were the answers to this, but at each
one Shorty shook his head. Finally he said,
&ldquo;Well, do you give it up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to, fellows,&rdquo; grinned Bert.
&ldquo;Go on and tell us, Shorty; why <i>is</i> it that an
automobile smokes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it can&rsquo;t chew,&rdquo; crowed Shorty triumphantly,
and dodged just in time to avoid a
piece of greasy waste that Bert threw with unerring
aim at his head. Amid cries of &ldquo;Lynch
him!&rdquo; and &ldquo;This way out!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let
him escape alive, fellows,&rdquo; Shorty took nimbly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to his heels and skipped behind a tree. After the
excitement had subsided Bert returned to his
grooming of the &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; and soon had
matters fixed to his entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was a hot, sticky afternoon, and the boys
had nothing particular to do outside of the routine
duties of the camp. They had been lying
around on the grass, lazily talking and listening
to the drowsy hum of an occasional locust, when
one had said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, I wish to goodness there was a little
wind stirring. I feel as though in about five minutes
I would become a mere grease spot on the
landscape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bert had replied, &ldquo;if you feel that
way about it, why not manufacture a little wind
of our own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manufacture it,&rdquo; had come a chorus of surprised
protest, &ldquo;how in time can you manufacture
wind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s very simple when you know how,&rdquo;
Bert replied, in an offhand manner. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to
prevent us from piling into the auto and taking
a spin? When we get out on the road I think I
can promise you all the breeze you want. What
do you say, fellows? Want to try it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer was an uproarious shout of approval,
and accordingly Bert had been getting
the machine in shape.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>In a short time they were ready to start, and
as they were getting in they discerned Shorty&rsquo;s
stocky form emerging from the trees. He signaled
frantically for them to wait, and soon came
up panting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you weren&rsquo;t going without me, were
you?&rdquo; he asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Bert, &ldquo;you deserve almost
anything after springing a thing like that on us,
but I guess we can forgive you, if we try real
hard. Shall we take him along, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what Shorty needs to come for,
anyway,&rdquo; said Ben, slyly. &ldquo;It seems to me that
a fellow that can run as fast as Shorty did a little
while ago can make all the wind he needs himself.
He doesn&rsquo;t have to get in an automobile
to get swift motion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Bert, with a serious face,
&ldquo;still, probably Philip has other views, and so
we might as well give him the benefit of the
doubt. Jump in, old scout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was easier said than done, however, as
the big red auto was already literally overflowing
with perspiring boys, but they managed to
squeeze in, and started off, singing three or four
different songs all at the same time, and each one
in a different key.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to be bothered much by this,
however, and they soon reached the hard, level,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
macadam high road. Bert &ldquo;opened her up&rdquo; a
few notches, as he expressed it, and they were
soon bowling along at an exhilarating pace. The
breeze that Bert had promised them soon made
itself felt, and you may be sure it felt very grateful
to the overheated boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This beats lying around on the grass and
whistling for a wind, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Frank,
and, needless to say, all the rest of the boys were
emphatically of his opinion.</p>

<p>They had been going along at a brisk pace for
several miles when they heard the purr of another
motor car in back of them, and glancing
back saw a handsome-looking blue auto creeping
up to them. A flashily dressed young man,
smoking a cigarette, was driving it, and three
girls were sitting in the tonneau. The blue machine
overtook them steadily, and soon was
abreast of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, Bert,&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, excitedly, but
in a low voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to let them
pass us, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let them, if they want to,&rdquo; replied Bert;
&ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t come out for a race, and I feel just
like loafing along and taking things easy. What&rsquo;s
the use of getting excited about things on a hot day
like this? Besides, I don&rsquo;t think those people are
looking for trouble, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point the blue car passed them, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and as it did so one of the girls in the tonneau
looked back and called, &ldquo;How does the
dust taste, boys? Like it?&rdquo; The fellow driving
it laughed at this sally, and shouted, &ldquo;Hey,
youse, why don&rsquo;t you get a horse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the boys looked at Bert to see how he
would take this. He said never a word, but his
grip tightened on the steering wheel, and the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; gave a lunge forward that almost
jerked some of the boys out of their seats.
Faster and faster the powerful car flew, and it
was evident that they would soon overtake the
blue car. The latter was also a first rate machine,
however, and the boys could see one of
the girls in the tonneau lean over and speak to
the driver. The blue car started to draw slowly
away, and Bert opened the throttle a few more
notches. The motor took on a deep, vibrating
note, and the hum of the gears rose to a higher
pitch. Soon they began to overtake the car in
front, and now it became evident that the latter
was doing its best. The &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; fairly
&ldquo;ate up&rdquo; the intervening space, and in a few
moments had come up to within a few yards of
the laboring blue car. The driver looked back,
and seeing that the big red car in back of him
would surely pass him in another few seconds,
swerved his own car over so that it was squarely
in the middle of the narrow country road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
There was a shallow ditch on each side of the
road, and the only way Bert could pass him was
to take a chance of overturning and run two
wheels in this ditch. Usually he would not have
thought of exposing the boys to such a risk, but
now he threw caution to the winds. Amid
hoarse and excited cries from the boys he &ldquo;gave
her the limit,&rdquo; to use his own expression, and the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; seemed fairly to leap ahead.</p>

<p>He swerved the big machine into the ditch,
and the wheels bumped and pounded over the
uneven surface. The big car fairly shot by the
blue machine, however, and amid a triumphant
shout from the frenzied boys regained the smooth
road and hid the defeated challenger in a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p>Then Bert slowed it down a little, but kept
well in the lead. The blue machine had evidently
given up in despair, however, and gradually
dropped back until a turn in the road hid
it from their view. The boys broke into an excited
discussion of the recent &ldquo;brush,&rdquo; and all
were enthusiastic in their praise of the staunch
old &ldquo;Red Scout.&rdquo; They also had many flattering
things to say in regard to Bert&rsquo;s driving,
until he was forced to protest that he would have
to buy a hat about five sizes larger, as he could
fairly feel his head swelling.</p>

<p>Finally the excitement subsided somewhat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and the boys had time to look around them and
get their bearings. It did not take them long to
find that they were in unfamiliar surroundings.
They had gone at such a fast pace that they had
covered more ground than they would have believed
possible. Bert consulted the odometer, or
distance recording instrument, and announced
that they had covered almost thirty-five miles!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to do some
tall hustling to get back to the camp in time for
lunch. We&rsquo;ll keep on a little way, until we get
to a place where the road is wide enough to
turn around in, and then we&rsquo;ll beat it back as
fast as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, they rounded a sudden
turn in the road and a gasp arose from
every boy in the car. Not fifteen feet ahead of
them was a railroad crossing, and giving a
lightning-like glance up and down the track Bert
saw that there was a train approaching from
both directions. It was obvious that the automobile
would not be able to get across in time,
and at the brisk rate at which they were traveling,
it was equally impossible to stop the machine.
It seemed inevitable that the auto would
be struck by one or both of the ponderous locomotives,
and it and its occupants be crushed to
atoms.</p>

<p>The boys turned sick with horror, and gripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the sides of the automobile without being able
to say a word. Their eyes gazed without winking
at the two rushing locomotives, and they
were unable to move.</p>

<p>But Bert saw that they had one, and only one,
bare chance of life. He did not try to apply the
brakes, which would have been useless and fatal,
but as the big auto reached the railroad tracks
<a href="#image01">he wrenched the steering wheel around and
headed it directly up the track</a> in front of the
northbound train. As he did this he opened the
throttle, and bent over the wheel in a desperate
and almost hopeless attempt to beat the flying locomotive
until the engineer, who of course was
using every means in his power to stop his train,
could check its momentum and give them a
chance to escape.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; bumped and swayed wildly
over the uneven ballasting and ties, and the boys
breathed heartfelt prayers that nothing on the
staunch car would break. In spite of all Bert
could do, the fast express train gained on them,
although sparks were streaming from the
wheels where the brakes were clamped against
them. The engineer had reversed the locomotive,
and the great driving wheels were revolving
backward.</p>

<p>The momentum of a fast and heavy express
train is not a thing to be checked in a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
however, and the boys in the rear of the automobile
could feel the heat from the locomotive
boiler.</p>

<p>But the powerful automobile had gotten &ldquo;into
its stride&rdquo; by this time, and was fairly flying over
the uneven roadbed, and to the boys it felt as
though it were only hitting the high places, as
Frank afterward expressed it. For a hundred
or two hundred feet the train failed to gain an
inch, and then the brakes began to tell and it
gradually fell to the rear.</p>

<p>Shorty leaned over and thumped Bert on the
back and yelled: &ldquo;Slow up, Bert, slow up!
We&rsquo;re out of danger now, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert glanced back, and saw that Shorty was
right. They were drawing rapidly away from
the locomotive, so he reduced speed, and the automobile
gradually attained a safer pace, and at
the first opportunity Bert swung it up off the tracks
and onto a country road. This done, he stopped
the machine, and leaning on the steering wheel,
buried his face in his hands. He said not a
word, and the boys could see that he was
trembling like a leaf. In a few moments he recovered
himself, however, and the boys began to
overwhelm him with questions:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you ever think of going up the
track instead of trying to get across, Bert?&rdquo;
inquired Frank. &ldquo;If you had tried to cross that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
would have been the last of us, because we could
never have made it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did it because it was the only thing to be
done, I guess,&rdquo; replied Bert, in a shaky voice.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no end of a fool to go at that speed on a
road that I don&rsquo;t know, anyway. I don&rsquo;t know
what I could have been thinking of to take such
chances. Mr. Hollis will never have any confidence
in me again, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; retorted Bob, indignantly.
&ldquo;Why, if Mr. Hollis could have seen the presence
of mind you showed, I think he would trust
you all the more, if that is possible. Not one
person in a hundred would have thought of doing
what you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s not all of it, by any means,&rdquo;
said Bert, in a mournful voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that
we&rsquo;ve broken something on the old car, as well
as almost getting ourselves converted into sausage
meat. Here goes to look things over, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thorough inspection failed to reveal any
break in the mechanism or frame, however, and
even the tires were intact. Finally Bert straightened
up with a relieved expression on his face, and
said: &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t seem to find anything at
present, that&rsquo;s one comfort. However, I
wouldn&rsquo;t have believed that any car could stand
such punishment and hold together. We won&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
kick against fate, though, for not smashing our
car for us, will we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; agreed Shorty, heartily, &ldquo;I
think we ought to thank our lucky stars that any
of us are left to talk about it, even. It&rsquo;s more
than we had a right to expect fifteen minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Shorty, at that,&rdquo; agreed
Bert, &ldquo;but now, we&rsquo;d better make a quick sneak
back to camp. Mr. Hollis will have given us up
for lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly the boys all climbed into the car,
and they were soon humming along on their
homeward journey. You may be sure that Bert
slowed down almost to a walking pace at every
turn they came to, however, and once, just for
fun, he said, &ldquo;Say, Shorty, I don&rsquo;t like the looks
of that curve ahead of us. Perhaps you had
better get out and go on ahead to make sure
that the coast is clear. I intend to be on the
safe side this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shorty immediately entered into the spirit of
the joke, and vaulted out over the side of the
tonneau while the auto was yet in motion, and
disappeared around the curve. As the auto
crept around the bend its occupants could see
Shorty waving his handkerchief and signaling
for them to come on. Bert laughingly complied,
and, as they passed Shorty, stopped a moment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
give him a chance to climb aboard. Shorty was
soon in his place, and Frank laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, Bert, that&rsquo;s being careful for fair. If
Mr. Hollis could have seen that I think it would
have made up for our going too fast and almost
getting smashed up. What do <i>you</i> say, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a unanimous chorus of assent to
this proposition, but Bert did not join in the
laughter. He felt in his heart that he had been
careless, and he knew that even his subsequent
presence of mind in getting them out of a tight
scrape did not wholly atone. His mind was
filled with these thoughts, when Bob said, &ldquo;Say,
fellows, I don&rsquo;t see why we have to say anything
to Mr. Hollis about our near accident, at all. It
will just make him angry at us, and maybe he will
not want to let us use the car again. Besides,
now that it&rsquo;s all over, it won&rsquo;t do him any good
to know what a narrow escape we&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Bob, that would never do in the
wide world,&rdquo; replied Bert, quickly, and in a reproving
voice. &ldquo;The last thing we ought to
think of is to deceive Mr. Hollis, and you know
it. I&rsquo;m surprised that you should even have
mentioned such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no harm done, is there?&rdquo; replied
Bob, but in a rather shame-faced manner.
&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t do it if you don&rsquo;t think we ought to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
so there&rsquo;s no use getting mad about it. I just
offered that as a suggestion, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Bert, &ldquo;the chief blame for this
thing lies on me, anyway, and as soon as we get
back to camp I intend to make a clean breast of
the whole matter to Mr. Hollis, and he can do
as he thinks best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, have it your own way,&rdquo; growled
Bob, sullenly, and they relapsed into silence. By
this time it was almost dark, and Bert was forced
to drive very slowly, as he had never been over
that particular road before. He had a well-developed
sense of location, however, and was
pretty sure that he was going in the right direction.</p>

<p>As it proved he was not deceived in this, and
they shortly struck a road with which they were
all familiar. Bert ventured to accelerate their
pace somewhat, and it was not long before they
came in sight of the cheery camp fire, around
which Mr. Hollis and the boys who had not gone
on the automobile trip were seated. As they
heard the sound of the machine the group around
the fire leaped to their feet, and Mr. Hollis
walked slowly toward them. When the auto
swung into the circle of fire light and came to
an abrupt halt, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has been detaining you, boys? It
seems to me that you are not treating me quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
right by going off in this manner and returning
at such an hour as this. Why, you should have
been back two hours ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A chorus of excited exclamations rose from
the boys, but Mr. Hollis raised his hand for
silence. When this had been restored, he said,
&ldquo;One at a time, boys, one at a time. Here, Bert,
let&rsquo;s hear your explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Bert proceeded to give in a very straightforward
manner, and did not attempt to gloss
over any of the details of his recklessness, as he
was pleased to call it.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis listened with a serious face, and
when Bert had finished, said, &ldquo;Well, Bert, you
were certainly to blame for taking chances in
the manner that you did, but, on the other hand,
you deserve credit for the presence of mind and
courage you showed in extricating your companions
and yourself from what might very easily
have been a fatal accident. Still, you were right
to tell me all about it, and I think that to-day&rsquo;s
experiences may have the effect of making you
more careful in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be sure, sir, that I will never be so
careless again,&rdquo; promised Bert, and by the tone
of his voice, Mr. Hollis knew that he meant it.</p>

<p>It was a hungry lot that sat down to supper
that evening, and little was spoken of except
their thrilling experiences of the day. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
supper, however, they began to feel the effects of
the exciting day, and all expressed themselves
&ldquo;tuckered out.&rdquo; As Frank said, &ldquo;He felt too
tired to take the trouble of going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all managed to overcome this very important
objection, however, and soon there was
no sound to be heard in the camp except the
rustling of the embers in the camp fire as they
slowly burnt themselves out and settled into
ashes.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mountain Scouting</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Sunshine! glorious, golden sunshine! Was
ever sunshine more bright? Was ever sky
more blue? Was ever day more beautiful? So
questioned our campers as, fresh and glowing
from a cold plunge in the lake, a hearty breakfast
despatched, bedding aired and cots freshly
made up, camp cleared up and morning duties all
attended to in tip-top fashion, they mustered
about Mr. Hollis to receive the day&rsquo;s commissions.</p>

<p>It mattered little what might be the commission
allotted to each squad. Anything, everything
that might come to them in the way of
camp duty, could not but be a pleasure on such
a glorious day as this. With young bodies
aglow with health, young minds, awake and alert
for all new impressions, young hearts filled with
desire to live right, to do right, to be kind and
helpful to all with whom they came in contact,
how could they help being happy?</p>

<p>The camp was full of merriment, but perhaps
the happiest squad of all was the auto squad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
In fact this was always the case, but today the
autoists had a special expedition. They were
to play the mountain scouting game, and as the
nearest mountains were at a distance from camp
the squad had been detailed for the automobile.</p>

<p>Gaily the fellows piled in and away they flew.
As the roads which they must travel today were
rough, their progress was much less rapid than
usual; but, despite this they reached their destination
in about half an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the &lsquo;Red Scout,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Bob,
as they tumbled out of the car. &ldquo;If she can
travel like that over these roads, what&rsquo;ll she do
on the race track? Oh, say, fellows, the &lsquo;Gray
Ghost&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be in it. She&rsquo;ll fade away like a
real ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish the day of the race was here,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;Seems as if it would never come,
doesn&rsquo;t it, fellows?&rdquo; and &ldquo;It sure does,&rdquo; they
all chorused.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; were really very high,
rocky hills, but, as they were known to embrace
many very steep and dangerous ravines, some of
them nearly as perilous as mountain precipices,
many and earnest had been the warnings given
by Mr. Hollis as the boys had started on their
expedition, and each boy carried in the pockets
of his jacket some part of the equipment for
first aid to the injured that was a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
camp outfit. Thus safe-guarded, they felt no
fear.</p>

<p>As soon as they had arrived the three &ldquo;hares,&rdquo;
who had been coached in the game, went to hide
themselves in the mountain, and, after sufficient
time had been given them for this purpose, the
&ldquo;hounds&rdquo; followed them; while Bert and Dave
Ferris remained in the auto to watch for any
signal that might be given them from the mountain.</p>

<p>The game of mountain-scouting consists in the
&ldquo;hounds,&rdquo; who must stay within certain limits
of ground, finding or &ldquo;spotting&rdquo; the &ldquo;hares&rdquo;
within a given time. If they find or spot them
even with field glasses, it counts, provided that
the finder can tell who it is he has spotted. The
hounds write down the names of any of the
hares that they may see. If at the end of the
allotted time no hare has been spotted, the hares
win.</p>

<p>To-day two hours had been the given time
and the boys in the mountains were to signal
to Bert the news as each hare was found.</p>

<p>Time was nearly up. Three hares had been
found. The chase had been a merry one and
now hares and hounds together, no longer
pursuers and pursued, but just happy-hearted
campers were hiking down to the two in the automobile.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The return signal had been given, and Bert
and Dave, relieved of the slight anxiety they had
felt while the game was going on, expected each
moment to see the boys come into view.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dave sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Look,
Bert,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;another signal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Breathlessly the boys read the signal wig-wagged
to them from a point high up on the side
of the hill. &ldquo;Come quick! Fred hurt. Bring
splints and kit and ropes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took only a very short time for the boys to
reach the scene of the accident, and one glance
took in the situation. Turning a corner the boys
had come, all unknowing, upon a spot where the
rocks shelved suddenly down into a deep ravine.
The edge of the descent was hidden by a fringe of
breast-high bushes, and Fred Morse, all unconscious
of his danger, had stepped upon a piece
of rock which gave under his foot, and, before
the boys could even put out a hand to save him,
had slipped through the bushes, and the horrified
boys had heard their comrade go crashing
through the bushes on the side of the ravine.
His frightened cry, &ldquo;Help, fellows, I&rsquo;m falling!&rdquo;
still echoed in their ears. While two of
the boys were signalling, the others had called
to Fred but no reply had come back to them.
When Bert reached them, Bob was running along
the edge of the cliff, in great danger of going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
over himself, in a vain effort to find a place to
climb down.</p>

<p>Now, not waiting for the call for volunteers, he
ran to Bert and begging him to hurry and help
him, began fastening the ropes about himself.
In a twinkling, the rope was adjusted, the knots
securely tied, and the rope firmly held by four
boys, Bob was lowered slowly and carefully over
the side of the cliff.</p>

<p>Down, down he went till, just as the boys began
to fear that the rope would not be long
enough, it lay slack in their hands, and they knew
that Fred was found. Presently came the signal,
three distinct pulls on the rope, and soon
poor Fred was lifted tenderly over the edge and
laid gently down. A few minutes more and good
old Bob was back with them.</p>

<p>Now, all attention was turned to Fred. After
a careful examination from head to toe, Bert relieved
the anxious fears of his comrades by the
announcement that he was sure that Fred&rsquo;s life
was not in danger. A faint cheer went up, which
faded when Bert said Fred&rsquo;s leg was broken.</p>

<p>Consternation filled their hearts, for the nearest
doctor was miles away, and though Bert felt
sure there was no more serious injury than the
broken limb, it was hard to tell what internal
injury might have been sustained, and a long ride
in the motor with the leg in the present condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
might prove a serious matter. There was no
doubt about it, the leg must be set at once.</p>

<p>Not one of the boys had anything but the
simplest knowledge of first-aid-to-the-injured, but,
though at first hearts feared and hands trembled,
they conquered fear and each boy went steadily
to work to do his part. Whether it was to hand
the cotton batting or to pull with full strength
upon the poor broken limb, or hold the splints
while Bert wound yards of bandage around
them, not a boy flinched, and at last the work
was done, and well done.</p>

<p>Then with faces scarcely less white than
Fred&rsquo;s own, they turned to the task of making a
litter on which to carry him down to the motor.</p>

<p>After a long search, for the hill was almost
barren of trees, being covered mostly with
scrubby bushes, two short and two long saplings
were found and, laying two of the boys&rsquo; jackets
on the ground and running each of the long poles
through the sleeves of a jacket, the two jackets
were buttoned together with buttons down. Then
the short poles were lashed on and a comfortable
stretcher was ready to their hand.</p>

<p>In the auto on smooth roads, carried tenderly
by his fellows over the rougher places, they at
last reached the office of the crusty old village
doctor and laid Fred on the couch for the doctor&rsquo;s
examination. But though the doctor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
crabbed, he was skilful, and in a very short time
the temporary splints were replaced by permanent
ones and the party turned toward camp.</p>

<p>Homeward-bound in the auto at last, the boys
drew a great sigh of relief and weariness. What
an eventful day it had been! Begun so brightly,
it had nearly ended in a tragedy, and at the
thought their hearts swelled with gratitude that
they were taking dear old Fred home with them
alive, and, if not well, at least only the worse for
a broken leg and some severe bruises. They
could not be thankful enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that going along the road ahead?&rdquo;
asked one of the boys, and all saw, walking in
the middle of the road and directly in the path
of the motor, a little bent old woman&rsquo;s figure,
the most conspicuous article of whose dress was
a bright red, very draggled looking feather which
drooped from the brim of a very ancient hat.</p>

<p>Very tired and pathetic, the old figure looked
to the boys as they brought the machine to a
stop beside her, and the old wrinkled face, wet
with tears that was turned to them when they
spoke to her, made every warm boy&rsquo;s heart ache
with pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s Kitty Harrigan&rsquo;s old mother, who
has just come over from Ireland,&rdquo; said Dick, in
a low voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, fellows,
how we laughed when Mr. Hollis told us about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
her the other night? He said, you know, that
the poor old lady had been quite a village belle
in her young days, and now, in her age, she
imagines herself back in her girlhood. Look at
her now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, the old lady was a study, for no sooner
did her old eyes fall on Bert&rsquo;s handsome face as
he spoke to her, than tears were brushed hastily
aside, and with a coquettish glance from her
brown eyes that, despite the years, were still
bright, she made him so deep a curtsey that her
long black coat swept the ground.</p>

<p>She had eluded all watchful eyes, and slipped
off by herself for a walk, and when she wished
to return, had taken the wrong direction, and
was walking away from home instead of toward
it. She had enjoyed herself immensely at first,
making the most of her seldom-obtained freedom,
but now her old feet were very tired and
the old limbs that had carried her sturdily for
nearly ninety years were growing weak at last,
and, after such unusual exertion, were trembling
beneath her.</p>

<p>At the boys&rsquo; proposal to take her into the car
and give her an automobile ride, the tired old
face broke into a smile, and, as the boys settled
her in the most comfortable seat in the tonneau,
she leaned back luxuriously, and, clasping her
old hands, said in ecstasy, &ldquo;Did annybody iver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
see the loike of Biddy Harrigan ridin&rsquo; in an artymobile,
no less.&rdquo; She beamed upon the boys, she
patted the hands and shoulders of all of them
within her reach, and in her rich Irish brogue
showered compliments upon them; for a very
demonstrative creature was old Biddy Harrigan.
She did not notice that mischievous Bert, whom
she had called a &ldquo;rale foine gintleman,&rdquo; took
advantage of her flow of talk to sing in a very low
tone, &ldquo;&lsquo;H-a-double r-i-g-a-n spells Harrigan&rsquo;,&rdquo;
but the boys found it very hard to keep their
faces straight.</p>

<p>On Fred&rsquo;s account, poor Fred, who had, perhaps,
shown more courage than anyone else in
that day&rsquo;s ordeal, for not one word of complaint
had he uttered through all his pain, the boys felt
that they must go on to the camp where he could
get the rest and attention he so sadly needed.
They did not know that what was causing him
keener anguish than the physical pain was the
fear that he would be unable to be on hand on
that day of days which he, like every other fellow
in camp, had thought of every waking moment,
dreamed of every night and looked forward
to with daily-increasing impatience&mdash;the
day of the race between their adored &ldquo;Red
Scout&rdquo; and the challenged &ldquo;Gray Ghost.&rdquo; To
miss seeing the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; come in gloriously
victorious (not a single doubt of her victory entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
any boy&rsquo;s mind), what was the pain of a
broken leg to the misery of that possibility! But
they did know that he needed care, so they carried
Biddy Harrigan with them. As supper was
ready when they reached camp, they placed Biddy
in the seat of honor and regaled her with the
best of the camp fare.</p>

<p>Never had an old women enjoyed herself so
much. She could not get over the fact that the
delicious supper had been cooked by boys. &ldquo;If
Oi hadnt of seen it and tashted it, Oi niver,
niver would have belaved,&rdquo; she said over and
over again.</p>

<p>After supper they hurried the old woman,
gesturing and exclaiming at the delight of another
&ldquo;artymobile&rdquo; ride, into the auto and soon
had her home.</p>

<p>Irish Kitty, who washed for the camp, was
overjoyed at her old mother&rsquo;s safe return and
overwhelmed them with gratitude.</p>

<p>The boys last view of Biddy was a grateful,
curtseying, waving, delighted old woman who repeated
over and over again, &ldquo;O&rsquo;ll not forgit yez,
B&rsquo;ys, O&rsquo;ll not forgit yez. Yez&rsquo;ll hear from old
Biddy agin,&rdquo; and they did.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By a Hair&rsquo;s-Breadth</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Tap, tap, tap, tap&mdash;tap, tap&mdash;tap, tap, tap&mdash;sounded
in Ben&rsquo;s ears before he was fully
awake and conscious. He sat up in bed and listened,
and asked himself what that sound was.
Was it rain? At the thought his heart grew
heavy with apprehension. Rain on <i>this</i> day,
when he and Bert and Tom were going to auto
ten miles over to the Red River for a day of
trout fishing. The other fellows, who did not
care so much for fishing, were going on a tramp
with Mr. Hollis, and he and his chums were to
have the auto all to themselves the whole day.</p>

<p>Slipping noiselessly from his cot, he lifted the
tent flap and stepped outside. The first rays of
morning sunshine beamed full in his face, and
the insistent noise that had aroused him proved
to be the tap-tapping of an energetic woodpecker
out for the proverbial &ldquo;early worm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Delighted at the prospect of such a glorious
day, he rushed back into the tent with a hop,
skip and a jump, at sight of which Don, always
ready for a frolic, began frisking about and barking
joyfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, there was no sleep after that for
the other fellows, and, bath and dressing and
breakfast dispatched as soon as possible, the
three boys, seated in their beloved auto, and
bidding a noisy good by to the rest of the camp,
sped away on their quest for trout enough for a
rousing fish dinner that evening.</p>

<p>You would have had to go a long way to find
a merrier or more care-free set of boys than our
three adventurers. Used as they were, by this
time, to the automobile, it never became an old
story to them, and now, as the swift motion of
the car sent the cool air rushing against their
young faces, with the sunshine turning everything
to gold, and with the prospect of a day of rare
sport before them, they gave full vent to their
overflowing spirits. They shouted and laughed,
and chaffed each other until many a staid farmer
or farm hand, starting early work in the fields,
or doing chores about the barns, found themselves
smiling in sympathy. They recalled the
time when they were boys, and the whole world
just a place to be happy and jolly in.</p>

<p>The boys had enjoyed the ride so much, that
all three were almost sorry when Tom pointed
out the gleam of water through the trees, and
they knew that Red River was at hand; but in a
moment nothing was thought of but the fun of
getting ready for their day&rsquo;s sport.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Tumbling out of the &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; laden with
fishing baskets and tackle and rods, they raced
down to the river bank, selected each a shady,
grassy, comfortable spot, and, line and reel and
hook adjusted, were obliged at last to curb their
wild spirits, still their noisy chatter, and settle
down to fisherman&rsquo;s quiet, although irrepressible
Tom, unable to subside at once, sang softly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hush, hush, not a breath, not a breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ve a nibble, still as death, still as death.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The others could not resist joining in the
chorus of the old song, and regardless of consequences
sang lustily:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh, the joys of angling!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the joys of angling!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the joys, oh, the joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joys, the joys of angling.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then a Sabbath stillness descended on the
party, until Ben shouted, &ldquo;first bite,&rdquo; and giving
his line a sudden jerk and swing, landed a beautiful
speckled trout upon the grass a few feet
away.</p>

<p>For a few moments excitement reigned, and
cries of &ldquo;Hurrah for Ben,&rdquo; &ldquo;good for us,&rdquo;
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t he a beauty?&rdquo; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s keep it up,&rdquo; were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
heard, until Bert&rsquo;s &ldquo;We certainly won&rsquo;t keep it
up unless we keep quiet,&rdquo; sent them back to their
places and again quiet reigned.</p>

<p>Ten, fifteen, twenty minutes went by, and there
were no more nibbles. The boys were beginning
to get restless, when Bert landed the second
fish, and, a couple of minutes after re-baiting his
hook, added a third beauty to their collection.</p>

<p>Tom, seeing the success of his comrades, began
to feel as though he were being left on the
outside of things, but Bert encouraged him by
reminding him, &ldquo;First the worst, second the
same, last the best of all the game,&rdquo; and sure
enough, after nearly half an hour of most trying
waiting, he suddenly felt his line twitch, and
had the joy of landing the largest and finest fish
yet caught.</p>

<p>When the excitement had a little subsided,
Ben said, &ldquo;I think we ought to celebrate that
dandy catch, and the very finest way would be
to have a feast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As, what with the stirring ride and the excitement
of the sport, each fellow felt, with Bert,
that he was hungry enough to &ldquo;eat nails,&rdquo; the
hamper was brought from the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; and
unpacked with scant ceremony.</p>

<p>Every boy who has spent a day in the open
will know exactly how <i>good</i> those cold chicken
and ham sandwiches tasted; and the way the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
doughnuts vanished was something to see.
Washed down with a drink of cool water from
a nearby spring, it was a luncheon to be remembered.</p>

<p>Again settling themselves in their chosen
places, they continued to try &ldquo;the heedless finny
tribe to catch&rdquo;; for four trout, even though they
were fine, large ones, would, Tom said, regardless
of the aptness of his simile, be no more than
&ldquo;a drop in the bucket for all those hungry fellows&rdquo;;
but their luck seemed to have changed.</p>

<p>For more than two hours not a nibble disturbed
the quiet of those exasperating lines, and,
as the ground, although covered with springy
grass, is not the softest seat in the world, the
boys&rsquo; patience was tested to the utmost. They
lay outstretched, resting on both elbows, and
Tom, tempted by the heat and the absolute quiet,
was just falling into a doze, when he was aroused
to immediate action by the violent twitching of
his line. A moment more, and another speckled
victim was added to their store.</p>

<p>For the next hour and a half the fish bit almost
as fast as they could bait their hooks, and
they were kept busy hauling in one after another,
until, in the joy and excitement of the sport, they
lost all count of time. Fortunately for the camp,
Bert suddenly made the double discovery that
they had more than enough fish, and that if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
was to be a fish dinner at camp that night, they
would have to stop at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make a quick sneak,&rdquo; said
Ben, who, in moments of excitement, sometimes
forgot his most polished English.</p>

<p>Hastily packing their catch in the fishing
baskets they had brought, they tossed them and
the tackle into the auto, scrambled in themselves,
and were off and away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; goes fine,&rdquo; said Tom, as
the great car gathered headway. From the beginning,
the auto race, which even the wonderful
day&rsquo;s sport could not completely banish from
their minds, had been the almost exclusive topic
of conversation among the campers, and now that
the day was rapidly drawing near, they could
think of little else. &ldquo;Is she in first-class condition,
Bert?&rdquo; asked Ben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bert replied, &ldquo;except that I noticed
on the way out this morning that the brake did
not work as well as usual. As soon as we reach
home I will find and remedy the trouble, whatever
it is. If worst comes to worst I can send
to the factory for a new part, which would reach
us inside of twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time about half the ten mile stretch
had been covered, and now they had begun to
descend a very steep hill. Suddenly Bert&rsquo;s face
went white. Tom, chancing to look at him, exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Bert?&rdquo; and Bert
replied, &ldquo;The brake won&rsquo;t work, fellows.
Something&rsquo;s stuck. I can&rsquo;t control the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then for a moment all yielded to a panic of
fear. &ldquo;Oh, Bert,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;you <i>must</i> stop
her.&rdquo; &ldquo;There must be <i>something</i> you can do,&rdquo;
begged Tom.</p>

<p>Looking into the frightened faces of his two
companions, Bert recovered his self-control, and
resolved to do his best to avert an accident.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, fellows,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
steering gear is all right. Just sit tight and keep
a stiff upper lip, and we&rsquo;ll come through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Bert, the bridge!&rdquo; gasped Tom, and at
the same moment a vision of the narrow bridge,
scarcely wide enough for two autos to pass, which
crossed the river at the foot of the steep hill,
and just where the stream was deepest, flashed
before their eyes. All realized that should the
automobile fail to pass over the center of the
bridge, and should strike the frail railing on
either side&mdash;Well, they didn&rsquo;t dare to think of
that.</p>

<p>Calling up all their courage, the brave boys
resolved to face, without flinching, whatever
awaited them. Once past the bridge and onto
the broad roadway beyond, they knew that they
would be safe. On level ground, with the power
shut off, they would come to a standstill.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>But &ldquo;would they ever reach that level roadway?&rdquo;
each boy asked himself, with sinking
heart.</p>

<p>Bert renewed his efforts to use the worthless
brake, but without avail. Down, down, they
flew, gaining speed with every passing moment,
and now the bridge was in sight. Another moment,
and they would be upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Courage, fellows,&rdquo; said Bert, in low, tense
tones, and bracing himself, he concentrated all
his mind and energy in guiding the car to the center
of the bridge.</p>

<p>When a few hundred feet away the forward
wheel struck a large stone, and the machine,
which had been headed directly for the bridge,
swerved to one side, and now sped onward toward
the river.</p>

<p>With lightning-like rapidity Bert wrenched the
steering wheel around, and once more, with only
a few feet of space to spare, the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo;&mdash;good
old &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; was headed <i>almost</i> for
the middle of the bridge&mdash;not quite&mdash;the space
had been too small. To the boys, looking
ahead with straining, despairing eyes, it seemed
that they <i>must</i> crash into the railing, and that
nothing could save them.</p>

<p>Instinctively they closed their eyes, as the car
dashed upon the bridge, expecting each minute
to hear the crash of breaking timbers, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
feel themselves falling into the engulfing waters
of the rushing river.</p>

<p>But the expected did not happen. Like a bird
the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; skimmed over the bridge,
missing the railing by a hair&rsquo;s breadth, and was
out upon the broad roadway. Almost before
the boys could realize their escape from the awful
danger that had threatened them, it was over,
and the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; gradually losing its speed,
at last stood still.</p>

<p>Breathless, speechless, dazed, almost overcome,
the boys sat looking at each other for a
few moments, until, the full realization of their
wonderful escape coming upon them, they grasped
each other&rsquo;s hands convulsively. Each knew
that in the other&rsquo;s heart, none the less earnest
for being unexpressed, was a fervent prayer of
thankfulness for their deliverance; but as speech
returned to them, the first words uttered by
Tom, were, &ldquo;What do you think of that for
classy driving, fellows?&rdquo; at which they all
laughed nervously.</p>

<p>Their laugh did not last long, however, for in
the midst of it, out from among the trees and
shrubbery that skirted the roadway emerged two
rural constables. As if one overwhelming experience
were not enough, the constables informed
them that they were arrested for exceeding
the speed limit.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Bert was the first to recover from the shock,
and giving his companions a comical, but reassuring
look, he stepped forward and said, &ldquo;We
have been speeding some, officers, but we simply
couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; and he proceeded to explain.
But the boys&rsquo; faces expressed their consternation
when they found that their explanation was
not credited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We only have your word for that,&rdquo; said one
of the men, &ldquo;and you will have to convince the
judge that you are telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you certainly won&rsquo;t arrest us for an
accident to our brake, for which we are not at
all to blame!&rdquo; cried Tom, indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said one constable, giving his fellow
a knowing wink, &ldquo;perhaps if you have a &lsquo;tenner&rsquo;
that you have no use for, we might forget
all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert, flushed and indignant, refused, and without
further protest, the three boys, followed by
the two constables, took their places in the car.
As they were only a short distance from town,
they soon arrived at the court house, and were
left in an ante room to await their turn for a
hearing.</p>

<p>Once alone, the three comrades stood for the
second time within an hour, looking into each
other&rsquo;s faces. As Tom afterwards said, &ldquo;too
full for utterance.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Ben began strutting around the
room in a most pompous manner, remarking, &ldquo;I
guess you don&rsquo;t know who we are. You know,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;that one is not a howling swell until
he has been pinched for speeding, so behold us
three aristocrats!&rdquo; with another strut across the
room.</p>

<p>The boys could not help laughing, but Bert
said, &ldquo;Well, if this is being an aristocrat, I&rsquo;d
rather be excused. It won&rsquo;t be quite such a
laughing matter if we find ourselves fined fifty or
a hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; began Tom, and said no more, for
at that moment they were called before the
judge.</p>

<p>They were obliged to stand by and hear the
constable&rsquo;s charge against them, given in detail.
Then the judge turned to them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are your names?&rdquo; was the first question.</p>

<p>Bert replied for the three. Upon hearing
the names the magistrate started, and looked
keenly at them, but said nothing further than to
ask what they had to say to the charge brought
against them. Bert gave a clear and connected
account of the accident to the auto brake, and its
consequences, and ended by saying, that if any
proof were needed, an examination of the brake
would show the truth of their account.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The judge accepted the boy&rsquo;s statement, dismissed
the charge against them, and turned to
them a face from which all sternness had vanished,
and been replaced by such a genial, friendly
smile, that the three comrades were filled with
wonderment. This was not lessened when the
magistrate asked them if they were the three
brave fellows who had stopped the two runaways
a few days before, and saved the lives of the
ladies who were driving.</p>

<p>With amazement that the judge should know
of the runaway, plainly written on their faces,
the boys acknowledged that they had stopped the
horses, but added that it was their auto that had
frightened the animals, and so it had plainly been
up to them to help.</p>

<p>The magistrate smiled more broadly at this,
but repeated that they were brave boys, and that
he was glad to meet them.</p>

<p>Looking quizzically at them, he said: &ldquo;I have
a special interest in those two ladies. One of
them is my wife, and the other my daughter, and
I can never repay you for what you have done
for me. You have made me your debtor for life.
If I can ever do anything for you, be sure and
let me know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another handshake all around, and the boys
found themselves free once more. Were they
happy?&mdash;well, you should have seen them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
they climbed into the car and headed toward
camp.</p>

<p>Events had so crowded upon each other that
for the first mile or so the three speeders sat
silently reviewing the occurrences of this most
amazing day. And Tom, recalling their court
room experience, broke out with:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Gee whiz, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No prison cell for me.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This provoked a laugh and broke the tension,
and a moment afterward a scouting party from
the camp hailed them boisterously: &ldquo;Where are
those fish?&rdquo; &ldquo;How long do you think we can
live without eating?&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand and deliver or take
the consequences&rdquo;&mdash;and as the auto came to a
standstill, the basket was snatched and hurried
off to the mess tent. Soon a delicious odor made
every hungry boy&rsquo;s mouth water, and when at
last they gathered around the table it was with
wolfish appetites that they paid their respects to
that belated fish dinner.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Biddy Harrigan Remembers</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;Cast thy bread&mdash;cast thy bread upon the
waters,</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it shall return&mdash;it shall return unto thee
after many days,&rdquo; chanted a clear, high voice,
truly a wonderful voice, which Bert claimed as
his own discovery.</p>

<p>It was almost bed-time in the camp. The day
had been a most fatiguing one, and all had returned
so weary that no one cared for the usual
lively evening entertainment. Even Mr. Hollis
had said that he was &ldquo;dog-tired,&rdquo; and he felt
with the boys that the very finest thing in the
world was just stretching out on the grass, resting
weary feet, and saying to one&rsquo;s self: &ldquo;Nothing
to do till tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a perfect evening, cool and quiet.
There was no moon, but the stars twinkled
brightly, and the boys had been looking up at
them and trying to make out some of the six constellations
that everyone should be familiar with.
But even that, in their present state of laziness,
was too much like work, and now they lay doing
and almost thinking nothing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Even Don, the big collie, that the tramps had
deserted, was not inclined to romp with the boys
as usual, but lay quietly with his great head resting
upon his paws. He had become the pet and
plaything of the whole camp and treated them
all impartially except Bert whom he had chosen
as his one particular master. He wanted no
other heaven than this&mdash;to lie, as now, close to
Bert, whose hand caressed his head while he said
now and again: &ldquo;Good dog&rdquo;; &ldquo;Good old fellow!&rdquo;
Don, like the boys, was at peace with
all the world.</p>

<p>Suddenly, someone started a popular air in
which all joined. This put them in a musical
humor, and song followed song, changing after
a while from popular music and rollicking college
songs to those of a more sentimental nature.
Most of the boys had good voices. With
the soprano of some, the tenors of the older fellows
and Mr. Hollis&rsquo; fine bass, the camp singing
would have delighted any lover of music.</p>

<p>Whenever the boys had sung together, they
had noticed that Phil&rsquo;s voice had never joined in
with the others. They had guyed him about it
but as he would never answer them, they had
come to the conclusion that he could not sing and
was sensitive about it, so they had stopped teasing
him.</p>

<p>To-night, as the notes of &ldquo;The Soldier&rsquo;s Farewell&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
floated over the camp, Bert noticed that
Shorty was singing for the first time, and though
his voice was low as though he were purposely
holding it back, for fear the attention of the
boys might be drawn to it, the notes were remarkably
clear and pure.</p>

<p>When the song ended, Bert turned to Phil
and asked him if he liked music. Phil answered
that he loved it and added more as if he were
thinking aloud than talking, that it was &ldquo;the
finest thing on earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys sat up and stared. There was a moment
of surprised silence and then a chorus of
voices:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can sing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never dreamed you could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you sing for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Phil, who had decided to tell
them the real reason at last, &ldquo;because all you
big fellows thought that just because I was small,
I couldn&rsquo;t do anything worth while, and I was
sore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellows expressed their regret and then in
responses to a few kindly questions put by Mr.
Hollis, they learned that Shorty&rsquo;s ambition was
to obtain a thorough musical education. They
learned too that for two years past he had been
the soloist in the boy choir of one of the prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
churches in New York. He had joined the
boy choir because there he could gain, without
cost, a knowledge of sight reading and voice control.</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sing something for us,
Phil?&rdquo; was not to be resisted and after a moment&rsquo;s
thought his clear notes rose in a burst of
melody:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cast thy bread upon the waters&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The boys fairly held their breath as the flutelike
notes of one of the finest voices they
had ever heard, floated off into the woodland
spaces.</p>

<p>When he had finished, every one sat spellbound,
paying the highest tribute of a moment
of perfect silence. Even when the silence was
broken by hearty hand clapping, the spell of the
music still brooded over them. It had been too
fine for noisy applause.</p>

<p>The boys&rsquo; appreciation of his singing was
very grateful to Phil, and not the least tribute
was Tom&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Gee, Phil, I hope the birds didn&rsquo;t
wake up to hear that. They would have been
green with envy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tension was broken by Sam&rsquo;s asking:
&ldquo;What does that mean, &lsquo;Cast thy bread upon
the waters&rsquo;&mdash;and how can it return?&rdquo; Mr.
Hollis was glad to explain that no kind deed or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
word is ever wasted, but is sure to return blessings
on the one who gave it, if only in the glow
that a kind action always brings.</p>

<p>But, uplifted as the boys had been, it is not in
boy nature to stay long upon the heights and they
soon came down to earth again.</p>

<p>Jim showed how fully he had come back to
earth by remarking as he suddenly remembered
that owing to a miscalculation as to the elastic
nature of a boy&rsquo;s capacity, both flour and corn
meal had given out, and that in consequence,
nothing in the shape of bread had come their
way that night: &ldquo;I wish some real bread were
coming tomorrow. I am not particular about its
coming by water. It can get here any old way,
as long as it comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of someone approaching the camp
aroused them. Irish Kitty appeared, with a big
basket on one arm and a great bunch of red
roses in her apron.</p>

<p>As soon as the boys saw the flowers, a shout
went up: &ldquo;Roses! roses! What beauties!&rdquo;
and on Kitty saying that she had counted them
and there was one for each, they were seized
upon and distributed in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Now, Kitty stated that she had a &ldquo;prisint for
the young gintlemin&rdquo; from her mother, Mrs.
Harrigan, &ldquo;to thank thim for the foine illigant
ride in the artymobile.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The big basket was uncovered and there lay
revealed to the eyes of the delighted boys a
number of large loaves of delicious homemade
bread. One did not need to taste that bread to
know its value. The firm white loaves spoke for
themselves. Corn bread they had in plenty
every day, but white wheat flour bread was not
included in their regular camp rations, so that
this was indeed a treat. They were all devouring
it already in imagination, and each wished
it were morning so that they might begin in
reality.</p>

<p>Kitty departed amid &ldquo;Good nights&rdquo; and
hearty thanks to her mother, and, camp bed time
having arrived, all drifted toward their tents,
Tom gaily singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has iver been connected with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harrigan! That&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All at once some one shouted: &ldquo;Look at Ben
Cooper.&rdquo; They turned to see Ben standing like
a statue, eyes fixed on nothing, staring straight
ahead of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that bread that we
cast on the waters on our way home from the
doctor&rsquo;s the other day sure did come back, didn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly did and it didn&rsquo;t take &lsquo;many
days&rsquo; either to get here,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; chimed in Shorty, &ldquo;a big bunch of
red roses thrown in, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Caruso,&rdquo; added Bert, throwing his arm
affectionately over Phil&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;you must
be a prophet as well as a singer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very soon the tired boys were off to dreamland,
where visions of loaves of fluffy white
bread, each loaf with a red rose growing out of
it, floated about, and imaginative Dave dreamed
that old Biddy made a &ldquo;prisint&rdquo; of a loaf to
each one, singing in a high cracked voice as she
handed them around: &ldquo;Harrigan! That&rsquo;s
me!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Race</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Bert, drawing a long
breath as he rose from his cramped position
beside the &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; &ldquo;this machine is
in as good condition as I know how to put it,
and if nothing happens I guess we can show you
fellows some speed this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the morning of the long wished-for race
and Bert was addressing an excited group of
boys, who were holding wrenches, oil cans, and
such other appliances as he might need in putting
the finishing touches on the pampered machine.
The whole camp was in a ferment of excitement
and expectancy, and many were the heartfelt
wishes for Bert&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>To these boys it seemed the most important
thing on earth that their machine should win, and
it is safe to say that if Bert had wanted to remove
a piece of black grease from the car and
had not a cloth handy, any one of them would
have sacrificed his best handkerchief without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and been glad to do it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, such a contingency did not arise,
however, and finally the last nut had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
tightened and the last fine adjustment made, and
everything was ready for the start.</p>

<p>The race was scheduled to start at two o&rsquo;clock,
but as the boys had to walk to the track, and
this necessitated a long detour around the lake,
they started almost immediately after breakfast,
so as to get there in plenty of time.</p>

<p>The boys in the two rival camps were not
the only persons interested in the race by any
means. News of it had leaked out over the
surrounding countryside during the week between
the completion of arrangements and the actual
race, and now there promised to be a goodly attendance
of farmers and their families.</p>

<p>Considerable interest was taken in the camp
by the kindly country folk, and now the boys
were surprised at the number of carriages and
farm wagons, full of jolly youngsters, that they
met on their march.</p>

<p>Every one they met shouted cheery greetings
to them, which they returned with interest. It
made them very happy to see the interest taken
in them by the farmers, and the very evident
good will expressed by them. They didn&rsquo;t take
the trouble to figure out the reason for this, but
it was not very hard to find. The fact is, the
boys were so manly and well-behaved that they
won their way into all hearts.</p>

<p>Many a time they had seen the boys stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
their machine rather than frighten a skittish
horse, and more than one weary farmer had
been given a lift on his way home from some distant
field.</p>

<p>So, as has been said, the boys were greeted
with expressions of good will on every side as
they marched along, and it made them realize,
perhaps more than anything else could, that it
paid to live a manly, upright life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in camp Mr. Hollis, Bert,
and Dick, were having a final discussion before
leaving for the rival camp in the &ldquo;Red Scout.&rdquo;
It had been decided that Dick was to ride with
Bert in the race, and give him any help that he
might need.</p>

<p>The other boys had been bitterly disappointed,
especially Tom, who had counted right along on
going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It only seems fair that I should go,&rdquo; he had
contended. &ldquo;Bert and I have always been special
pals, and I wanted to share any risk he is
going to take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Hollis was firm as a rock, as he well
knew how to be when he thought circumstances
required it of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little bit uneasy about the race, anyway,&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;and as long as somebody
has to take chances I want it to be some boy who
is old enough to be responsible for his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
actions. I know nobody could fill the place better
than you, my boy, but I am sure that when
you think over what I have said you will agree
with me in my decision,&rdquo; and Tom had to admit
to himself that, as usual, Mr. Hollis was right.</p>

<p>But now the time had come to leave for the
rival camp, and Mr. Hollis and Tom climbed
into the tonneau, while Bert and Dick occupied
the two front seats.</p>

<p>Soon they had started, and as they went along
Bert gave Dick his last instruction. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;that when we take the turns you
must lean as far toward the inside of the track
as you can. This may not seem to help much in
keeping those inside wheels on the ground, but
every little thing like that does help, and I think
that we will have to do everything we know how
to beat that &lsquo;Gray Ghost&rsquo; of theirs. That car is
no slouch, as the saying goes, and Ralph Quinby
knows his business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Bert,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to
remember all the things you have told me. I
really believe,&rdquo; he continued, laughing, &ldquo;that I
have forgotten more about automobiles in the
last week than I ever knew before. I never had
any idea that there was so much to know about
a car, and you certainly have got it down to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert was pleased at this evidently sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
tribute from Dick, and could not prevent a slight
flush of pleasure from mounting to his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dick,&rdquo; he remarked after a moment,
&ldquo;all I&rsquo;ve got to say is that if such a trio as
you and I and the old &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; can&rsquo;t win
that race, there must be something the matter
with the universe, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rival camp all felt as confident as did Mr.
Hollis&rsquo; troop, however, and to the impartial observer
it would certainly have seemed as though
there was little to choose between the autos and
their crews.</p>

<p>By this time they had come in sight of the old
race track, and were astonished, and, it must be
confessed, somewhat confused at the sight that
met their eyes. There was an old rickety grand
stand along one side of the course, and this was
literally packed with a bright-colored mass of humanity.
Even scattered around the infield
there were quite a few farm wagons, with their
complement of folks out for a holiday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Dick to Bert in a low tone, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t count on having an audience like this.
They&rsquo;ll guy the life out of us if we lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert, who by this time had recovered
from his first astonishment, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all
the more reason why we should win. We simply
can&rsquo;t let ourselves be beaten now, that&rsquo;s all there
is about it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was no time for further speculation,
as Mr. Hollis was seen approaching them, and
it was evident the race must soon begin.</p>

<p>Bert ran the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; around to a small shed
in back of the grandstand, and he and Dick made
their final preparations. These consisted in taking
off the hood, or bonnet, altogether, and removing
the exhaust pipes from the motor. As
Bert had already explained to Dick, this was
done to eliminate any back pressure from the
exhaust gases. Under ordinary conditions, this
makes such a small difference in the power of a
car that it can hardly be said to count, but in a
race every ounce of power is required. This is
done on every racing car, and that is why the
explosions make such loud, sharp reports when
the car is in action.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that every boy in Mr.
Hollis&rsquo;s troop, except poor Fred, was present,
and many were the anxious looks cast at Bert and
Dick to see, if possible, how they felt about the
outcome of the race. Both had been trained to
have control of their feelings, however, and so
outwardly they appeared to be very calm.</p>

<p>This was far from being the real state of their
feelings, and both felt as though their hearts had
suddenly become too large and were trying to get
out between their ribs. They realized that it
was not only their own reputation that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
suffer if they were defeated, but the whole camp
was involved. What would Mr. Hollis think of
them if the other boys were victorious? What
would the boys who had such blind confidence
in them and the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; do or say if the
&ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; won?</p>

<p>Such thoughts were demoralizing, however,
and neither Bert nor Dick entertained them any
longer than they could help. Into both their
faces came that stern, resolved look that all the
boys had seen at times and come to love, and in
the minds of Tom and the others all doubts as
to the final result vanished.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s troop had been
giving the &ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; its final touches, and
now, at the sound of a mellow whistle, both Bert
and Ralph cranked their motors.</p>

<p>None of the boys had ever heard the unmuffled
exhaust of a racing car before, and at the
savage roar that now issued from both cars all
the boys fell back several steps with scared faces.
As soon as they realized that the gasoline tank
had not exploded, nor any other equally awful
thing occurred, they came forward and tried to
ask questions, but in the confined shed they could
hardly hear the sound of their own voices.</p>

<p>Slowly the fire-spitting monsters were backed
out of the shed, and their respective drivers
swung them around and on to the track. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
were greeted by a wave of cheering both from
the boys and from the assembled farmers, and
more than one burly countryman who had come
to the &ldquo;kids&rsquo; racket&rdquo; under protest was seen to
sit up straight and open his eyes wide.</p>

<p>No doubt many of them had expected to see a
rather tame affair, and in fact few of them had
ever seen an automobile race, or knew the tremendous
speed of which a good car was capable,
or realized the cool head and steady nerves required
to control the condensed power of forty
horses traveling at a speed of close to a mile a
minute.</p>

<p>However, they were soon to experience a few
of the thrills attendant on such an occasion. The
two leaders had been holding a consultation,
and now they approached the vibrating, eager
cars.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis was forced to shout to make himself
heard above the din of the exhausts. &ldquo;It is
understood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this race is to be run
from a standing start, and is to be for a distance
of ten miles, or ten laps around the track. The
cars must line up on the tape that we have
stretched in front of the grandstand, and at the
report of my pistol they are to start, each driver
getting away as best he can. We have drawn
lots for the choice of position, and the &lsquo;Gray
Ghost&rsquo; won, and is to have the inside position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Mr. Thompson and I will act as judges. Is that
perfectly clear?&rdquo; to Bert and Ralph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; they both responded, and proceeded
to man&#339;uvre their cars into the appointed
positions.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis and Mr. Thompson took their
places in the grandstand, part of which the boys
had been directed to reserve for them.</p>

<p>By this time the cars were in position, each
one with its front wheels resting on the strip of
white tape. The &ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; had a decided
advantage to start with, as it is evident that in
any race the car that has the inside position, that
is, the part of the track nearest to the center of
the field, has a slightly lesser distance to travel
than the car on the outside, and in a close race
every few feet count.</p>

<p>But now there was a breathless hush over the
grandstand, and all eyes were on Mr. Hollis&rsquo;s
hand, holding the pistol aloft. Bert and Ralph
were bent over their levers, every muscle tense,
and nerves stretched to the breaking point.</p>

<p>Crack! went the pistol. With a mighty roar,
and the blue flames spitting from the exhaust
ports, the two great machines bounded forward,
and almost with one movement Bert changed the
gears from first to second, from second to high.
At every change the willing car leaped ahead
with ever-increasing momentum, and Bert felt a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
wild thrill run through his body as he realized
the vast force beneath him, subject only to his
control.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; had made almost as good
a start, however, and now, although the &ldquo;Red
Scout&rdquo; had a slight lead, the inside position
began to tell, and the &ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; gained a
trifle.</p>

<p>Dick, who had been looking back over his
shoulder, now turned to Bert and yelled excitedly
in his ear, &ldquo;Sock it to her, Bert! Give her
the gas! They&rsquo;re gaining on us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had now covered the first lap, and the
speedometer hand on the &ldquo;Red Scout&rsquo;s&rdquo; dashboard
registered a speed of fifty miles an hour.
Bert knew he could do better than that, but remembered
Mr. Hollis&rsquo;s instructions not to take
any unnecessary chances. The machine was
working beautifully, and a wave of pride surged
over him as he thought that this was largely due
to the care and work he had bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>But now the &ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; was ranging
alongside&mdash;ahead&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her a pump full of oil, Dick,&rdquo; yelled
Bert to his friend, and opened the throttle a
trifle wider.</p>

<p>The machine answered like a thing of life.
The wind whistled in their ears, the track seemed
a mere gray blur racing away behind them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the mighty speed song of the ravening motor was
like music in their ears.</p>

<p>Faster and faster they flew, the two cars keeping
pace side by side, and the speedometer hand
creeping up&mdash;up.</p>

<p>Fifty-two, fifty-three, fifty-six! it registered,
and the flying cars seemed barely to touch the
ground. On the straight stretch in front of the
grandstand they gathered such speed that at the
turns the rear wheels skidded, throwing up showers
of dirt, and the drivers were forced to slow
down a little or the machines would surely have
collided.</p>

<p>Up to that time neither car had a decided advantage,
but now they had covered the eighth
lap, and both crews realized that the time had
arrived to call on the racing engines for their
final and greatest effort.</p>

<p>The crowds in the stands were yelling like
maniacs, as each car in turn pushed its nose
ahead of the other. But Bert and Dick heard
nothing but the terrific roar of the racing cars.
Their pulses beat like trip-hammers; their eyes
were starting from their heads. They felt rather
than saw that the &ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; was gaining&mdash;gaining
only a little, inch by inch, but gaining.
Now it had come abreast; now it was slowly but
surely forging ahead. It looked as though the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; had &ldquo;shot its bolt,&rdquo; and its partisans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in the grandstand groaned in an agony of
apprehension that was fast becoming despair,
while their rivals danced up and down and
shrieked encouragement to their gray champion.</p>

<p>Now they were on the last lap, and suddenly
Bert leaned forward and advanced his spark to
the limit. It was do or die. His heart exulted
as he felt the splendid car leap forward. He
took a firmer grip on the wheel and threw the
throttle wide open. His mysterious &ldquo;sixth
sense&rdquo; had told him that he had something in
reserve, and now the &ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; justified his
judgment. It leaped, it flew. It collared the
&ldquo;Ghost&rdquo; just as they turned into the stretch, and
tore down the course, the explosions of its motor
blending together in one deafening volley of defiance

</div>

<p>Both cars made another circuit of the track
before they were able to stop, and then drew
up in front of the grandstand.</p>

<p>Immediately the crowd surged down, and in a
moment the two contestants were surrounded by
a frenzied mob of shouting and hat-throwing
boys, and almost equally excited, if less demonstrative,
country people.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis pressed forward and grasped the
hands of Bert and Dick, one in each of his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
&ldquo;You did nobly, boys,&rdquo; he exclaimed, but there
was a catch in his voice, and his face looked gray
and drawn, &ldquo;you did great work, but I would
not consent to your racing again for all the
money in the world. It is altogether too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But by this time the defeated boys belonging
to Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s troop had recovered a little
from their chagrin, and now elbowed their way
through the crowd, headed by their leader and
Ralph Quinby.</p>

<p>Like the clean-cut and manly fellow that he
was, Ralph walked up and shook hands with Bert
and Dick in turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you fellows certainly put up
a great race, and we have nothing more to say.
It was simply a case of the best car winning,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert appreciated his manly spirit, and replied,
&ldquo;It was simply a matter of the &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo;
having a little more speed. If we exchanged
cars, you would win and we would lose. You
gave us a hard tussle up to the last second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the other boys showed the same feeling as
had Ralph, and both parties separated with mutual
expressions of esteem and good will.</p>

<p>All the members of Mr. Hollis&rsquo;s troop that
could do so crowded into the &ldquo;Red Scout,&rdquo; and
various good-natured farmers volunteered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
make room in their capacious wagons and take
the rest home. Room was even found for Don,
who had been an excited spectator of the race
and was now regarded by the jubilant boys as
their mascot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little enough to do at that,&rdquo; remarked
one husky agriculturist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing to cart
the whole outfit over and back a dozen times for
the sake of seeing another race like that. I wish
old Dobbin could hike along like them things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in this he expressed the general sentiment
of the crowd.</p>

<p>As they traveled campward through the cool
twilight the boys shouted and sang, and in a
thousand other noisy but harmless ways found a
vent for their overflowing enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Bert and Dick were the heroes of the day, as
they well deserved to be. The race was run
again at least a hundred times, and by the time
they struck camp they had quieted down to some
extent. Their beloved car had, of course,
reached camp ahead of them, and now, as they
alighted and caught sight of Bert and Dick, their
enthusiasm flamed up again, and cheer after
cheer resounded through the silent woods.</p>

<p>At last they cooled down sufficiently to go to
bed, but it was a long time before they finally
got to sleep. Bert and Dick shook hands before
parting to go to their different tents. For a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
seconds they looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes, and
the grip of their hands tightened before they
finally separated and said good night. For when
two good comrades meet danger face to face and
win out, a new and never-to-be-forgotten bond is
riveted between them that lasts through life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a wildly hilarious group of campers who
sat down to a piping hot breakfast the next morning.
Some, indeed, had hardly slept at all, so
great was their rejoicing at the &ldquo;Red Scout&rsquo;s&rdquo;
glorious victory. They had won and the much-vaunted
&ldquo;Gray Ghost&rdquo; had had to &ldquo;take their
dust.&rdquo; What if it were their last day in camp?
As Jim, who was famous for mixing his figures
of speech, said, &ldquo;The camp, anyway, was breaking
up in a blaze of glory.&rdquo; Every exciting detail
of the great struggle was rehearsed and enlarged
upon, times without number. They crowded
round the splendid car and praised it and patted
it as though it were alive and could understand
how proud they were of its victory.</p>

<p>And Bert! If he had been anything but the
fine, manly fellow he was, he would have been
utterly spoiled by the plaudits heaped upon him.
He had been their hero before; now he was their
idol. His skill, his judgment, his nerve, were
dwelt upon to the exclusion of everything else;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
but he modestly disclaimed any credit and put it
all up to the car. &ldquo;This is the fellow that did
it all,&rdquo; he said, patting the great machine affectionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quoted Dick,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the steed that saved the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By carrying Sheridan into the fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Winchester, twenty miles away,&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">but all the same,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the steed saved
the day because Sheridan was on his back, and
the &lsquo;Red Scout&rsquo; saved the day because Bert
Wilson was at the wheel.&rdquo; And to this the whole
camp gave a thundering chorus of assent.</p>

<p>And Bert was at the wheel that afternoon,
when, after &ldquo;three times three&rdquo; given for the
&ldquo;Red Scout&rdquo; and its driver, the noble car stood
panting, crowded to the guards with as many as
could tumble in, ready to lead the way to the
station where they were to take the train to the
city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Tom,&rdquo; he said, as he grasped the
wheel and the great car sprang forward, &ldquo;I
never expect to have so much pleasure and excitement
in my life as I have had this summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bert was mistaken. A broader field and
greater triumphs lay before him&mdash;exploits that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
would tax every ounce of brain and muscle; victory
snatched from defeat amid the applause of
excited thousands. How he met the test and won
his fight will be told in the next volume, &ldquo;Bert
Wilson&rsquo;s Fadeaway Ball.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
